BUILD = built-files
# This BOOKNAME variable is the output file name, not the title:
BOOKNAME = By-Sound-Alone
# Metadata contains title and other info:
METADATA = metadata.yaml
# List of chapter files, in order, separated by a space.
CHAPTERS = manuscript/two_preface.md manuscript/1_Chapter.md manuscript/2_Chapter.md manuscript/3_Chapter.md manuscript/4_Chapter.md manuscript/5_Chapter.md manuscript/6_Chapter.md manuscript/7_Chapter.md
# Diagrams file. Diagrams are only added to epub and html, so that variable is in the pandoc lines for those sections below. 
# Diagrams are added by hand to pdf for book printing -- see latex notes.
DIAGRAMS = manuscript/one_diagrams.md 
# Contact page file. It goes in different locations depending on format, so it gets its own pandoc variable.
# (For epub, contact info should be included in 
CONTACT = manuscript/contact.md
# Similarly the license file's relation to CONTACT changes depending on format, so it too gets its own pandoc variable:
LICENSE = LICENSE.txt
# I think the cover pic works better if you use a .png or a .jpg -- only used in epub
COVER_IMAGE = cover/final-beta-front-cover-layout.png
# While it seems like it would make sense to use 'book' for LATEX_CLASS,
# book sets up the file for book printing -- putting end-of-book pages on the reverse of the front-of-book pages.
# (There's probably a latex option to change that, but that is the default for book.)
# 'report' puts in annoying chapter numbers that I can't figure out how to get rid of with pandoc.
# This document is fairly simple, so 'article' works well --- though see notes in README.md on compiling.
LATEX_CLASS = article
# This corresponds to the --css switch in the pandoc command:
CSS = css/clean-html.css
# This line uses the -M switch to override the 'rights' field in metadata.yaml and puts a version date into the compiled pandoc file. 
# (has to go here to run on the command line so it can use the 'date' command from Linux)
# The default setup puts in today's date automatically:

# 	Note: if you look at the original source from the maintainer for this ebook compiler they have a -S in these lines. That switch is deprecated in modern pandoc. I added the --from markdown+smart instead to the pandoc compile lines. ('smart' only does anything for markdown and latex outputs though, and is enabled by default, so this isn't doing anything.
