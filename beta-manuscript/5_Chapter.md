# 5. A Storm


[//]: # (### Shakes leads off the Grackle)


The _Gnat_ was off and the _Prospect_ submerged and cruising at depth before the first molten blob of malevolent red sun percolated up on the horizon. Shakes was running the _Gnat_ hot and loud, standing in the pilot's chair with his head above the hatch in the wind, trying to blow the bleary sleep out of his eyes. He sucked on a cigarette, but the wind was feeding oxygen to the coal on the end so that it glowed a color not totally unlike that of the sun coming up on the horizon behind him. His cigarette was quickly disappearing into itself. A long shadow of the short sail of the _Gnat_ with his round head on top stretched out in front of him on the slate-colored water.

 One-hundred meters below in the _Prospect_, it was nearly silent as the crew eased into their more relaxed daytime shifts. Captain Percy was in the control room smoking with Bastian. Cassandra had just woken when the boat dove and was making her way with a coffee to the sonar station for the long day watch.

The first few hours passed with dull regularity. Shakes had nothing to report during diesel stops, and by her third cheroot Percy was settling into the comfortable state of mind-blanking boredom that was her most familiar association with life aboard submarines.

[//]: # (Mid-morning: day 3, run to Stilt City)
Mid-morning of the third day out from the depot, Shakes was shutting down the diesel of the _Gnat_ for the fourth time that morning to check in with the _Prospect_. 

On sonar, Cassandra could heard the _Gnat's_ diesel putter away to a halt -- leaving a silent relief in her headphones. As usual, she called up to the control room to let them know the _Gnat_ was shut down for a listening and check-in session. "Captain Percy, the _Gnat_ just went silent."

"Alright. Thanks Cassandra." Percy called back down to her. Percy took down the ship-to-ship mic. "Captain Shakes -- the usual: how're things looking up there?"

"Well, for lack of anything else to report, I'll tell you that the weather is thickening up a bit. The haze has really set in, and there's a bit of a fuckin' chop coming on. It looks to me like the kind of things that could turn into real weather later."

Weather was not generally a concern for Percy, submarines could pass under even the worst weather at depth. But she could not guess at what the _Gnat_ was capable of handling. "Does that give you anything to worry about with the _Gnat_?"

"Naw," Shakes voice crackled, "the _Gnat's_ been through the very fucking worst. If it gets bad, I'll dive and ride it out underwater. With all this running on the surface, the batteries are always fully topped up so I can stay down for a while."

Knowing the _Gnat_ could not dive very deep at all, Percy was unconvinced that this was a solution to big weather, but she also knew Shakes had taken the _Gnat_ back and forth across the wide parts of the oceans many times. She decided to trust his experience. "Alright then Captain Shakes. If you..."

"Captain Percy!" Cassandra interrupted with a shout from sonar, "I think I've got a contact."

"Hold on Shakes. We might have a contact. Don't start your diesel." Percy hung up the mic and slid down the ladder.

Cassandra had her eyes closed and was concentrating intently on the sounds in her headset. She had the mics pointed towards the _Prospect's_ hard rear starboard quarter, and the signal strength indicator gauge was nodding weakly just a bit above the pin. "It feels like I'm only on the edge of the signal. They might be directly behind us."

"Bastian," Percy called up to him, "throttle down. Stop the props. Cassandra needs to hear what's behind us."

A moment later the perennially resonant electric motor sounds died away. Cassandra turned the sonar mics back to face the dead stern of the boat. The signal strength indicator immediately shot up to a definite contact. "Absolutely confirmed Captain Percy. I can hear the engine in the water. Sounds like another diesel."

Percy looked at the signal strength dial and knew immediately that the contact had subversively crept closer to them under the sound of the _Gnat's_ diesel when it was running, and then even a bit closer than that by aligning themselves dead astern of the _Prospect_ where Cassandra could not hear very well over the sound of the _Prospect's_ own prop turning. Based on the signal strength indicator, the contact was likely far closer than Percy was comfortable with now -- maybe twenty nautical miles. "Fuck," was all she said.

She climbed up to the control room and got Shakes back on the ship-to-ship. "Definitely a fuckin' contact Shakes. Now it's your turn. Fire up the _Gnat_ and see if you can lead them off and away from us. Let's see if this scheme of ours works!"

"Absolutely! Motherfuck..." The end of his oath was cut off by the whining start of the _Gnat's_ diesel engine which came blaring over the ship-to-ship radio for a moment before Shakes took his thumb off the transmit button.

Percy flipped on the red night lighting. "Bastian -- don't move the fuckin' boat. Don't trim anything or let her make any fuckin' sounds at all."

"Dead-silent-crypt drift, got it Captain," said Bastian.

Percy slid down to the sonar compartment again and tapped Cassandra on the shoulder. "Stay on both the new contact and the _Gnat_ Cassandra. I'm going to wake Hemi." Percy disappeared down the ladder to crew quarters and returned a minute later with Hemi's big form following her up from below. He was still pulling on his tweed jacket and fixing his spectacles while he sat at the sonar station and put on the second headset.

Cassandra looked at him, and pointed at the signal strength gauge and the bearing without saying anything. Hemi nodded while listening.

After a minute, Percy broke the silence. "Well, Hemi... is that our fucking creepy sub with the fuckin' ram?"

Hemi sighed. "It is -- the _Grackle_. Absolutely. The ram gives it a distinctive and entirely identifiable hull noise."

"Fuck me!" said Percy. "So much for the theory that they wouldn't fuckin' follow us this far into another Authority's territory. Ah fuck. It doesn't matter -- what matters is our current situation. Next order of business you two: are they following Shakes away from us."

Hemi took over the sonar directional control wheel from Cassandra and made some slight adjustments to center the signal. He flipped some switches to engage filters, and a moment later turned them off again. "You see Cassandra," he explained pointing to the switches and dials, "with these filters engaged I can better hear the _Gnat_, and with them disengaged it is easier to focus on the pursuing sub."

She nodded.

After a few minutes of listening Hemi reported to Percy: "it... seems like it is working Sylvia. The _Grackle_ is definitely following Shakes. And..." He paused for a moment to continue listening, "Shakes seems to be able to stay well ahead of them." He pointed to the mic directional indicator. "They are already 10 degrees off our course, and moving away quickly."

"That's fucking excellent Hemi," Percy said.

"Can't they like, shoot at Captain Shakes or something?" asked Cassandra.

"It is very difficult to hit such a small fast-moving target as the _Gnat_ with a torpedo. Though the _Gnat's_ engine is so loud that it is doubtful Shakes would hear an incoming torpedo. Hopefully he is experienced enough to make random course changes every 5 miles or so to make aiming a torpedo more challenging..." Hemi looked doubtful.

"Well, keep the fuck on them," said Percy. "Let me know if anything changes... or what the final result is." She stuck a cheroot between her teeth and climbed the ladder to the control room.

"Cassandra, keep tracking them," said Hemi. He stood up, still wearing the second sonar headset, and turned to lean over the navigation table. He measured the angle of the bearing to the contacts off their current position marked on the chart, and then drew a line marking Shakes and the pursuing sub's course. Listening carefully to what the sonar was picking up in his headset, he could estimate _Grackle_ and _Gnat's_ distance from the _Prospect_. 

He and Cassandra tracked the two sound sources like this for over an hour. Then he stood to his full height and stretched. He took off the headset and hung it on the peg, and patted Cassandra on the shoulder before climbing up to the control room.

"Shakes and the _Grackle_ are already far off and moving further out of range. I can no longer estimate distance on the sonar," said Hemi. "What is the end-game in this maneuver?" Shakes cannot run forever."

"Well, hopefully that fuckin' pursuing sub realizes they are on the wrong target at a good distance away from us. Then, presumably, they will leave off chasing Shakes and turn around to try to reacquire us here where they lost us. We will, of course, be long gone by then."

"So now would be the time for us to make a course change."

"Indeed. But my question for you, Hemi, is: how do we find Shakes again? You think you can raise him with that fuckin' bird?"

"I think Herschel will prove better than trying to reconnect with Shakes via radio. To get him on the radio, we both have to be on the surface at the same time, and he has to have his diesel off. Not to mention the radio could be monitored. We can let Herschel go with a message and dive immediately. The message would be extremely unlikely to be intercepted."

"OK. We'll surface tonight, and you can send the pigeon out after Shakes then."

Cassandra kept listening to the sonar for another half hour, occasionally reporting that she thought she could still hear the _Gnat_ or the _Grackle_ when the conditions were favorable. At that point Percy decided it was time to leave, and had Bastian throttle the electric motors up to 15 knots. They moved off on a southerly course that Percy selected at random to move them away from the area.

The rest of the hours of the day ticked by with nothing to break the monotony and no changes to make other than occasional minor adjustments to the trim of the boat. Whereas earlier Cassandra had been cursing the noise of the _Gnat's_ engine polluting the water, now she found she missed it. Somehow it had been comforting to know Shakes was up there on the surface. Not to mention that his hourly check-ins were at least a way to mark time and shift her attention. Now they were down in this dark cold pit of water, blind and alone, and it began to feel like they were doomed to remain like this until the end of their days.

[//]: # (### they hear the storm above, decide whether to surface)

[//]: # (Early-night: night 3, run to Stilt City)
Hours later, when the clock said it should be early evening on the surface of the world, Cassandra's eyes were bleary and drooping as she stared blankly at the sonar console. Captain Percy and Hemi were having a discussion behind her in the sonar compartment about whether it was time to surface and begin their nighttime run.

"How's the charge on the batteries Hemi?" Percy asked.

"OK, but getting low. We are at maybe 20 percent capacity."

"So, we could stay under maybe another 4 or 5 hours at a creep."

"Yes. We took a big chunk out of the batteries by leaving the area where we contacted the _Grackle_ at such a high speed."

"I know, but strategically, putting on some fuckin' distance was the right thing to do."

"I do not disagree," said Hemi.

"So when should we surface? We definitely want to run the diesels and put a charge back on the batteries, but it opens us up as a radar contact for those fuckers following us. They could easily still be within range to detect us on radar."

"And if they do, the whole move with Shakes would have been wasted."

"Fuckin' right. So, do you got a recommendation for me?"

Hemi turned to Cassandra and tapped her on the shoulder. "Any contacts on sonar Cassandra?"

She pulled back a headphone. "Nothing... mechanical. But the background noise of the ocean has changed Hemi. It sounds... weirdly energetic."

"Hmm." Hemi picked up the other headset and made some adjustments. He listened for a moment and pulled the headset off. "Well, that complicates things. Seems like we drove right into that storm Shakes was predicting."

"Fuck," said Percy.

"Ohhh..." said Cassandra to herself, "so that's what a churned up surface sounds like." She filed away in her mind another almost-magical aspect of sonar. "But Hemi, I don't feel any storm affecting the _Prospect_?"

"Even bad storms do not stir the water this deep."

"On the surface though," said Percy, "it's another fucking matter."

"...I hope Captain Shakes is alright." Cassandra muttered a little blessing for his well-being.

[//]: # (Cassandra is probably vaguely Catholic.)

"How bad does that storm sound Hemi?" Percy asked.

"Significant, I would say. There could be 10 meter waves up there."

"That's the kind of weather we're better off staying under."

"At least while we still have any battery left," Hemi agreed.

"Normally, that's the obvious move. But we need to be thinking ahead as well: staying down now could force us to the surface in daylight with no charge at all on the battery. We could end up a helpless target. If we go up now we can get the batteries charged up with very little chance of being found."

"Running on the surface in the storm does provide a lot of cover -- the radar will be swamped and the ocean makes enough noise to cover our running diesels... But it could also swamp us or crack the _Prospect's_ spine."

"She's a strong fuckin' boat Hemi, and with good pilots I think she can handle it. Let's prep to surface."

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
 

[//]: # (### they surface in a storm)

Hemi and Captain Percy climbed up to the control room. Bastian and Owen sat in the control seats watching the unmoving gauges with bored and sleepy eyes.

"We are going to surface," said Hemi. "And there is a serious storm up there. Owen, I am going to sit in that plane control chair. I need you to go down to the navigation/sonar compartment and get ready to blow the main ballast tanks."

"You want to do an emergency blow?" Owen asked.

Owen stood, and Hemi slipped his bulky form around him and down into the tight fit of the planes control chair. "Not a full blow. On my signal I just want you to open the high pressure air into the main ballast for a few seconds. I want to pop the boat up onto the surface. If we use the normal low-pressure system to ease up, there is too much of a chance for the intakes to be swamped in these seas. You all understand the procedure?"

Owen and Bastian nodded. Owen slipped down the ladder to the sonar compartment and they could hear him opening the toolbox that held the emergency blow wrench.

"OK Bastian, give us a little more throttle. I am adjusting the planes for some up-angle."

The bow of the boat rose slowly ahead of them, and Percy, being the only one standing, leaned into the angle. She found her pack of cheroots tucked into the wall joists, and pulled one out to light it. Bastian slipped a cigarette from his shirt pocket and lit it off Percy's coal.

"Hemi, another degree on the bow, I think," said Percy.

Hemi turned the plane control wheel slightly, and the boat eased to a somewhat steeper angle. He made some small adjustments on the trim tank control panel to make the front of the boat a bit more buoyant so the motors did not have to put quite so much energy into lifting the bow.

"I am going to come level at just about 10 meters, then we will have Owen blow air into the main ballast tanks." Hemi kept his eyes locked on the depth gauge, watching it crawl slowly back around towards the zero mark as the boat rose. Just as it passed the 10 meter mark, Hemi turned the plane control wheel and the bow of the boat came down to level. At this shallower depth, the boat took on the motion from the waves on the surface, slowly listing from one side to the other by 10 degrees or so. "OK!" Hemi yelled down to Owen. "Open the air into the main ballast Owen!"

Percy punched the emergency blow alarm, to be sure that this time everyone on the boat was aware they were performing a dangerous maneuver.

From below they heard the squeak of the turning valve, and a loud hiss. Air rushed through the pipes below them and out into the ballast. Hemi started counting to himself. There was a pause where nothing happened and then they all felt the upward acceleration of the _Prospect_ lifting.

Hemi's count hit five. "Close it down Owen!"

The hiss stopped, but the upward motion did not. Percy wrapped her fingers in the leather strap hanging over her head. They rode the force of the expanding air upwards for a few seconds and then the boat went weightless for a moment as it reached the surface. They could feel their stomachs rise within, and Hemi and Bastian's knuckles went white as they tightened their grip on the control wheels.

The depth gauge landed firmly on its zero pin and sat there. The boat rolled slowly and heavily with the surface swell.

[//]: # (### The Prospect rolls over)

All of these movements were well beyond the everyday range of motion for the _Prospect_, which typically experienced little more than a gentle roll in the course of a normal day of travel. But Captain Percy knew her boat very well after all these years. Even during a dramatic maneuver like blowing out the main ballast tanks, the boat was well within its capabilities. Her crew might have nervous looks on their faces, but Percy gripped her strap and casually smoked her cheroot as they took the express route to the surface.

The boat bobbed back downwards and began to settle. She was about to raise the periscope and have Chips prime the diesels for starting when she felt the deck below her feet move in a way that she was not expecting.

It was nothing very dramatic, just a slight roll and yaw that Percy's whole being knew simply was not right. If the _Prospect_ was a haptic extension of Percy's own body, this was like she had just tripped over her own feet. While she had no worries during the rise to the surface, this sudden strange motion of the boat made her break out in a cold sweat. Nobody else seemed to even notice it.

"Hemi... something's wrong," she said, but even the time it took to get the words out had been too long of a delay. A second motion that was far more dramatic had begun. She punched the collision alarm and the klaxon sounded in every compartment to the lowest depths of the boat.

The _Prospect_ started to list to the starboard side. It was the motion of some sky-scraping giant lifting them closer to his near-sighted eyes for inspection without regard for the orientation of the strange object in his hand. In this case, the giant was a 20-meter rogue wave.

The _Prospect_ rolled hard over to starboard, and it did not stop rolling.

"Hemi! You brought us up in the ditch of a wave! We're going over!"

The port wall became the ceiling. The boat was rolled over 90 degrees on its side by being caught in the wrong part of a huge wave. It kept rolling even past 90 degrees. Captain Percy crashed into the starboard wall. Hemi put one arm out to brace himself, and the other arm against Bastian to brace him. Hemi's enormous strength rippled through his body and held the two men firmly in place at their control stations, defying gravity. From every deck of the boat came the shifting, crashing sound of previously carefully stowed objects falling hard against the starboard side that was now acting as the temporary deck.

As on all ships, the crew generally kept objects secured by strap or rail against the roll of the vessel. This both kept things from falling out of place with the normal motion of the boat, and on a submarine prevented a falling object from potentially making enough noise to give their position away on sonar. But objects were secured against maybe a 20 degree roll, not a 90 degree roll. At that angle nearly everything in the boat found itself yanked free by the malevolent hand of gravity.

The lights blinked a few times and then shorted out as bilge water made its way to places it did not belong. A few moments later the control room and sonar compartment were lit with the harsh white glare of the battery-backup emergency floodlights.

From the sonar compartment, Cassandra screamed. "Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. Is this it? Are we fucking going down?" 

Hemi responded to her with forceful strain, "Cassandra! Do not panic. Submarines are designed with all the weight at their bottoms. They always come upright eventually."

"Except when they fuckin' don't," said Bastian, but only loud enough for Hemi to hear.

"Hemi, what about the cargo?" Percy asked.

"We will put our faith in the packing material. If one of the warheads does explode, we will know it immediately. And a few seconds after that, it will not matter."

Bastian coughed.  "What if we try to submerge again?" he asked.

"I'd be too worried about the tanks flooding unevenly. We could end up turning fuckin' turtle," said Percy. "We need to ride it out. She'll come up again..."

The sub rocked on its side for terrifying minutes, sometimes rolling in the wrong direction far enough that it seemed impossible they would not end upside down. Occasionally the lights would flicker, but continually shorted out. They listened to the ongoing sounds of the boat's stores crashing and sliding through all the compartments.

As Hemi strained to hold himself in place and support Bastian in his, he began to doubt his own words. Maybe this was one of those times that the boat was not going to come back upright. And even if it did, coming upright could always be the motion that set off one of the magnetic warheads. Cassandra had been reduced to whimpering on the deck below them, though they could hear that Owen had made his way over to her and was telling her things in a low voice they could not hear but clearly had a reassuring tone. Bastian just kept saying "fuck!" every few seconds, with more and more frustration.

Captain Percy lay against the starboard wall. She spat, and her intuitive expectation gleaned from years of experience that she would watch it arc to the deck was defied by gravity, which pulled the brown glop back against the side of the ship.

But as she was the first to feel the boat go wrong, Captain Percy was also the first to feel it begin to right itself. There was the slightest relaxing of the angle, she could feel a tiny bit more pressure from the deck through her boots, and somehow she knew it was the beginning of a more substantive movement. The _Prospect_ was telling her she was coming back up.

At first it was just a slow rotation, but then it gathered speed and soon the control room was whipped up into the air, and then came back again as the _Prospect_ found its upright footing.

[//]: # (### Hemi gets them straightened out; confrontation with Chips)

"Fuck!" said Bastian. "Now what?"

"Forward throttle!" said Percy, "do the motors have power?"

From far below decks came the ramping-up hum of the electric motors spinning the props. The boat's capabilities were severely limited without main power, but power between the batteries and electric motors that drove the props was isolated from the main power its own circuit as a safety precaution for an emergency situation such as this.

"Fuckin' motors do have power, Cap," said Bastian.

"Small favors," said Percy to herself. "OK Bastian, pick a bearing and keep us moving on it. Hemi! Get up on the bridge -- with a fuckin' lifeline -- and get us steering into the waves so we don't roll over in the fuckin' ditch again."

"You do not want to dive?" Hemi asked.

"Not without main power through the boat."

Hemi nodded, and slipped down the to the lower decks to go after the gear he needed.

Percy grabbed at the boat PA mic and thumbed the transmitter, but there was no power to any of the radios. She leaned over the hatch to the sonar compartment. "Owen! Go find Chips and help her get the power back on."

"Right Percy." Owen headed off quickly, nearly running into Gregory who was stumbling up from crew quarters.

"You alright Gregory?" Percy asked.

"Ya, I fucking fell out of the rack when we rolled, but I'm O-fucking-K."

"Good. Get a flashlight and go down to the cargo hold and check the cargo -- make sure nothing's about to explode on us, and get it re-stowed, OK?"

"Ya, I'm on it." Gregory pushed his way forward through the compartment against the sudden mountain grade he faced as the boat rocked. Now that it was on the surface, the _Prospect_ was taking a beating from the weather.

Hemi returned wearing a full-length rubber foul-weather slicker and carrying a coil of heavy rope over his arm.

"We will not be able to see much up there Sylvia. We need to rig some floodlights."

"I know, but we can't do that without power. Just do your best to feel your way out of the fucking ditch. As soon as the main power comes on, we'll send some clamp-lights up."

Hemi opened the hatch at the top of the control room, and wind immediately whipped into the boat, driving rain with it. Hemi climbed up, secured the heavy line around himself, and hitched it to steel rings welded in place behind the fairing of the bridge. The topside world was an environment of darkness pressing against blackness. Hemi was surrounded by huge moving mountains of pitch, rolling upwards and trying to touch the black sky that hung just over them, pressing down. 

"OK Bastian!" Hemi shouted down to the control room, "left-rudder, three degrees."

Bastian shouted the order back up to Hemi, repeating it like the pilot of a military ship would, knowing that Hemi had to be sure he was executing exactly the move Hemi needed.

"I think you can try starting the diesels Sylvia," Hemi shouted a moment later.

[//]: # (I guess I'm just assuming Chips got the starters for the diesels back together -- she certainly had plenty of time.)

Captain Percy stepped up to the engine control panel located just behind Bastian. This panel was showing no power to the lights and indicators that usually glowed comfortably as they communicated to the control room crew that the core propulsion systems of the boat were working. Percy flipped the switch to turn on power to the diesels regardless -- that circuit was also isolated from the main power circuits as a safety precaution. She pushed and held the starter buttons for the diesels. These were mechanically rigged to valves in the high-pressure system that let air flow into the engines with enough force to turn over the crankshaft and the big cylinder bores. The diesels required no external electricity source to start or run.

After a few seconds of listening to the high-pitched hiss of air flowing through the boat and down to the engines, Percy heard the rumbling vibrations of the diesels firing down in the deep parts of the boat and released the starter buttons. 

"A little more throttle Bastian!" Hemi called down after the diesels started bellowing their confident exhaust behind him. Now he felt the _Prospect_ had the muscle to confront this big weather they were driving into.

A few minutes later the regular lighting came back on, and the harsh shadows of the emergency floodlights faded away. Power returned to the ship panel by panel, along with the reassuring hums of all the electric motors, circuits, and filaments that bathed every moment of their lives onboard the boat.

Percy picked up the PA mic. "Nice work Chips." She waited a second but there was no reply over the ship PA. "Bastian, I'm going to the cargo hold to check on the load."

The ship was a mess. Percy made her way stepping over all the detritus of a working sub scattered over every deck: tools, bedding, cans of food, cleaning supplies, scattered stacks of papers, half-unrolled charts, pencils, rags, parts, and steel-encased equipment. For all the mess in the main decks though, the cargo hold was not too bad. Hemi's careful re-arrangement of the cargo crates earlier had included strapping the crates hard up against the wall, and the old cotton-web straps had mostly held. Only a couple of crates had broken loose. Owen and Gregory were using the chain hoist to move the loose crate from the center area of the cargo hold. Chips had joined them, and was stowing equipment that had been shaken loose. She had one of the broken bicycles that had escaped from the rusty bicycle pile in her hands when she saw Percy.

Chips' face immediately went red. "That's the second fuckin' time Percy. Two fuckin' times you almost fuckin' killed me now. You fuckin' surface the boat in a fuckin' storm? Fuckin' damn you to a cold fuckin' watery hell you fuckin' shit-faced asshole."

"Fuck you Chips! I'm fucking captain this boat. I have to make these calls. They aren't always going to be fucking perfect or safe."

"But with a hold full of fuckin' explosives? Ride out bad fuckin' storms submerged -- every stupid-fuckin' green boat driver knows that. But apparently, you fuckin' think it's fine to surface with a hold full of fuckin' TNT. We were a fuckin' mite's-dick away from being blown to the bottom of the fuckin' hole!"

Percy leveled her emotions. "I don't fucking need this right now. I have bigger problems than you." Percy turned and walked away.

Chips threw the rusted bicycle frame into the corner with the other bicycles. The hollow tubes of thin steel crashed and locked together.

[//]: # (### They drive through the storm)

[//]: # (---- REVIEWED TO HERE ----)

With the power restored, Captain Percy tracked down some powerful floodlights in the storage hold. They were designed to be clamped onto the fairing of the sail for situations like this, where the boat needed to be piloted visually from the top of the sail, but visibility was nearly zero. Powering the lights required running heavy weather-proof electrical cables up from the control room to the bridge. 

She called on the PA for Gregory to come help her. Together they managed to get the heavy lighting units hauled through the control room and up to the bridge of the sail. In the slashing rain, Percy held each of the four lights in place while Gregory clamped the lights onto the fairing by bolts tightened with a wet and slipping wrench. Gregory draped the cables down through the sail and into the control room where he connected them to high-amperage power sockets.

So far, Hemi had been mostly guessing from which way the big waves were coming at him, and having Bastian adjust the course to to keep them moving laterally across the trough of the waves, where they faced the most risk of rolling over again. The powerful lights pushed back the darkness to reveal the black throbbing landscape surrounding him and stretching out in front of him. Huge mountains, the color of crude oil, slipped towards him and under the boat, lifting it high up among the spindrift blowing white from their peaks and violently twisting off deep into the ferocious darkness.

Hemi tried to spot the big ones coming at him from a couple of waves away. When he saw one, he would have Bastian steer into them, driving up their sides, splitting through the top and crashing down into the valley below. The wind blew without relent, carrying a mix of rain and blown water from which no distinction could be made whether it was moving upwards or downwards.

To the uninitiated, this was a hellscape, an unstable surface on an alien world. Any ship in weather like this was a tiny figure on a vast plane roamed by monsters the size of apartment buildings that arrived with stealth, and an ability and intent to crush even the most formidable intruders and drive them down into the bottomless hole they effortlessly strode over.

But Hemi felt no fear as long as the hum of the diesels shook his boots, and the heat of the exhaust bellowed from the pipes behind him. He had been through weather like this hundreds of times over the years and knew a well-found ship with a strong engine should have no trouble. As old as the boat was, he had all faith in the _Prospect_. The storm could try its evil best to do them down, but Hemi was not going to go without a fight.
 
[//]: # (First quarter of night: night 3, run to Stilt City)
After an hour of firing into the storm, the giant on the bridge was starting to feel the wear of it though. Hemi was not a loud man, and his voice was already cracking from shouting directives down to the control room. It also took an enormous amount of energy to keep his concentration focused on the nearly-featureless black seascape. Wild as it was, it became debilitatingly repetitive in a short time. It also took physical stamina just to stay standing on the bridge against the wind and roll of the boat. But the most distressing thing to Hemi was that he had only been at this for an hour. There was a chance they could be running through the dark of this storm until dawn -- something like 10 hours away.

Owen, dressed in a black foul-weather slicker that covered him from crown to calves, where it draped over heavy rain boots, climbed up through the sail to join Hemi on the bridge. 

"Captain Percy sent me up." Owen shouted to Hemi through the wind. "She wants me in the lookout ring. Seems kinda stupid to me."

Hemi nodded. "The sour prospects of fortune are determined by the winds that blow out of hell, Owen. I do not believe there is more to see from the lookout ring than down here on the bridge. Still, I will be glad to have help spotting incoming big ones... and someone to witness my end if I get blown overboard."

"Maybe that's the real fucking reason she wanted me up here!" Owen grinned at Hemi as the rain soaked his face.

Owen clipped on a lifeline and climbed up to the lookout ring, his hands almost glowing white where they peaked out from under the black slicker and gripped the wet steel ladder. In the lookout ring, he doubled up his safety line. From that modest height it looked like he could reach up and touch the long drifting tendrils of the low scudding clouds above his head. He withdrew a pair of binoculars from under his slicker, but they were nearly useless in a matter of seconds. He reverted to holding the brim of his hood down to shade his eyes from the water that came down at him. Though little good it did against the water that rose up at him.

[//]: # (### Cassandra on sonar in the storm)

Down in the sonar compartment Cassandra's eyes were watery and red. She had been on sonar watch for more than twelve hours. Twelve hours of staring at the same screen and set of gauges, which never showed the slightest change. While she had quickly adapted to the typically very gentle motion of the submarine, now it was moving like the worst kind of low-riding surface ship. It lifted her up, and dropped her down, sometimes hard enough to lift her from her chair. But unlike a surface ship, there were no windows. No way for her to see any kind of horizon by which she could orient her confused inner ear. Sickness rose up in her again and again, and she kept forcing it back into herself. The only relief was the occasional cool, wet breeze that found its way all the way down through the open hatch in the control room to her far front corner of the sonar compartment. 

She had expected to be in her rack hours ago, but Captain Percy had come by and asked her to stay at the sonar. She had told Cassandra that, while it was unlikely they would meet any other vessels in a storm like this, sonar might be the only way they would know if another ship was coming at them, despite the noise of the storm. With so much precipitation, the radar was essentially useless and Percy had turned the unit off.

Cassandra literally hung on. She gripped the handles on either side of the sonar unit in her small hands, her fingers curling around the cold painted and chipped steel, her fingernails digging into the soft flesh of her palms. The tension in her arms had passed from a searing ache to a dull background pain hours ago.

She slowly closed her large eyes and focused on the sounds in her headset. She left her body behind in the boat, and moved her mind out into the water. This had become easier and easier with practice, though overcoming the exhaustion and pain of a long shift made it more challenging now.

The ocean was overwhelmed by the sounds of the storm on the surface, and the heavy drone of the diesel engines reverberating through the hull of the _Prospect_. The whole boat shook with the vibration of the grinding cylinders. The engines provided a low frequency bass note that cut a never-varying line of deep sound through the sonar.

Above the engines in pitch was the sound of the waves. This sound was white, but unlike the drone of the diesels was constantly changing and shifting. It was a heavy sound that curled and rolled, until a wave broke. When that happened, the sound would change to a rushing wall which would overtake everything until it receded a few seconds later and the low drone of the engines came back up underneath.

When she concentrated, Cassandra could hear the whistle of the wind itself, pressing against the surface of the water and driving it with its vicious will.

Those sounds all combined into a heavy repetitive groan that rose and fell depending on which source was taking over at any moment. But cut across that was the sound of the motion of the boat itself. Every minute or so, the bow would break out of a wave, accompanied by a new rush of wind on the sonar mics. Then it would be followed by the crunching sound of the boat plunging back under the water, which would run out in the long stream as she heard the water rushing along the side of the hull.

All of this came together to form something that, to Cassandra's ears, sounded like an almost spiritual music -- a drone music from the culture of some remote land, with variations that held one's interest as they carried you off to some distant plane, but then always came floating down to return to the same home place. The grinding roll of it all seemed like some animistic entity's effort to raise the consciousness of someone lucky enough to be listening to a place where one could see out forever. Out through thousands and thousands of miles of empty ocean, to pick out some particular particle or source and understand what exactly its intentions were: the mind of a sperm whale 3000 meters down in the blackness, closing its jaws around the expelling sweet juices of an enormous cephalopod, or the byzantine economics that led to the churning roll of a machine bit boring into the ocean floor, or the tortured path of beach sand siphoned from its existence in the warm sun and deposited in the freezing darkness of the drowned depths.

[//]: # (Cassandra knows of drone music because the cultural flow through the depot included people from all over the world -- even if she didn't exactly _experience_ the culture/music.)

Cassandra let her mind sink into this strange music flowing through her headset, passing from one ear through the middle of her head to the other ear, at the same time letting her mind wander around in the sea surrounding them. This went on for more than an hour before she was jolted back to the sonar compartment by the distraction of Captain Percy and Chips having a loud and heated argument behind her. That was unfortunate because just at that moment she believed she could hear a new sound out in the darkness. It was something faint and far off. It was something incongruous and inappropriate.

She opened her eyes and looked at her instruments. She swung the mics around towards the boat's rear starboard side. At about 160 degrees there was a slight, but very real, wavering of the signal strength indicator. It just popped its head up for a second, like some prairie rodent checking for raptors. Cassandra spun the mic direction wheel back across the bearing, and the needle went up and down again. Back and forth she scanned, and each time the needle bounced and now she was sure that she could hear a faint mechanical hum in hear earpiece when it did so.

She focused the mics on the source of the mechanical sound in the water, and listened to it. It was nothing more than a soft hum that had diffused itself across some unknown amount of the dense medium she worked in, gently tickling the sensitive membranes of the ship's mics, and then running close to the speed of light through the ship's wiring, past the condensers and filters of her equipment, up the fading braided wires of the headset and into her ears. For all that, it was a pulpy mush of a signal, barely discernible as mechanical save for the slow cycle of rising and falling at just a few hertz, but in a evenly repetitive way that was unmistakable.

She struggled to figure out if the source was far off or if it was closer but moving very quietly. The drone of the engines and the background noise from the surface was interfering with and confusing her sense of distance in the water. It made her feel a little like she was lost and alone on the surface, being lifted and dropped by the force of the storm. The source of the sound might be visible one second, and then she was deaf and blind under the water, and by the time she came to the surface again it had moved away.

Captain Percy and Chip's argument grew louder. Cassandra had the sense they might be on the verge of blows. The verbal exchange kept pulling her back to the sonar compartment when she knew she needed her mind out there in the water. But she still felt she did not have the authority to enforce quiet in the compartment.

She rested her elbows on the console, and cupped her hands over the metal and leather pieces of the earphones. She listened to the mechanical hum in the water, and tried to guess by the difference between her right and left ear how far away that sound was. But the white noise of the storm washed it all into one blended continuous sound. She stared at the signal strength indicator and dared it to move. 

And then it did. It jumped up, marked a point and floated there for half a second. It was accompanied by a rattling clink in the headphones -- metal on metal somewhere out in the liquid expanse. A dropped steel pot or piece of equipment perhaps. The sound was distinctive, carrying Cassandra back to her childhood, to playing on the floor of a kitchen while a meal was being prepared above her. She tried to hold on to the feeling of safeness that brought to her as in her earphones the rattling-pot sound took on an other-worldly echo. An echo that her mind processed for distance -- which brought the rising terror of how close she now knew that sound to be.

"Captain Percy! They're right on us!" she turned and yelled.

Percy immediately broke off with the red-faced Chips and stared at Cassandra, her eyes going wide. It took her a second to process what Cassandra had said. "A contact?" she asked Cassandra to confirm.

"Yes!" Cassandra put all the conviction she could into this word, worried that she wasn't conveying the seriousness of the situation quickly enough.

"How close?" Percy asked.

"I don't know!" Cassandra panicked. "Too close! They're _here_!" She pointed her finger at the console. "Rear left side of the ship."

[//]: # (### The pursuing sub rises and starts to shoot)

Percy grabbed the gray steel rungs of the ladder up to the control room, feeling the old paint fleck off under her fingers where she gripped the rungs excessively tightly. She flew up the ladder, cupped her hands around her mouth and yelled up to Hemi, "Contact! Close rear port quarter!" She could hear Hemi repeating the information up to Owen in the lookout ring.

Owen made a motion to pull out the binoculars from under his slicker, but as he looked in the direction Hemi indicated, he realized he did not need them. There before him rose a shadowy leviathan, breaking out from the dropping curve of the next wave behind them. It was so dark that Owen would have thought it was literally a leviathan -- something in the order of baleen whales -- except as soon as its huge dorsal area split the surface, two holes appeared in its back, from which poured out a bright red glow, like the eyes of some corrupted pet of hell. The shadows of people briefly caused those eyes to blink, and Owen knew they were moving onto the deck of another sub that was so close it looked like the next wave could drop it on top of the _Prospect_.

Owen cupped one hand to his mouth and stretched his arm out to point in a gesture that dated back to the dawn of humans venturing out onto water. "Hemi!" And with the foreboding sense that they might be the last words he ever spoke, Owen could not keep the note of mortal terror from his voice. "It has come through the waves and is on us now!"

Hemi turned and looked, and instantly knew the _Prospect's_ only course of action. "Dive!" he shouted downward as he smashed the button for the alarm. He looked up at Owen in the lookout ring. "We have to dive Owen! Get below!" The alarm klaxon sounded up to him from below in the control room.

Long thin fingers of flame reached out from the submarine behind them and split the darkness between. It was followed instantly by the low, fast cracking sound of heavy automatic weapon fire and the sickening thud of lead slamming into the thick steel of the _Prospect's_ sail. It rang with a clanging echo through the hull.

Hemi immediately dropped to the deck of the bridge, below the protective ridge of the sail's fairing, and then lowered himself down through the interior of the sail and into the control room. He looked up through the open hatch and called loudly for Owen.

"Were they fucking firing on us? That same fucking sub -- the _Grackle_?" Percy asked.

"Yes. I saw the ram," said Hemi. "We need to dive. Now. Open the main ballast vents." But he knew his words were redundant. Gregory had already shut down the diesels, and Bastian was putting an angle on the dive plane and the main ballast was flooding. The bow tilted towards the depths. But the row of lights that showed the status of the hatches contained one glaring red light among the green -- the control room hatch.

The depth gauge had already climbed off its zero pin. The deck of the _Prospect_ would be awash in a matter of seconds. The control room would be under shortly after that. Hemi looked up through the open hatch "Owen! We're going down!" But all he could see was black rain blowing across the bridge. "He was pretty exposed up in the lookout ring when they started firing. He may have been hit," Hemi said to Percy.

They suddenly all made a coordinated, involuntarily, and wincing motion to duck down as more shrapnel hit the sail. 

A rain of blood driven by the wind sprayed down through the open hatch above them.

Through the hatch they could hear a loud, low voice, enlarged by loudspeakers mounted to the sail of the pursuing sub, so that all enunciation blended together into one long echoing drone of command. "Do not submerge. Disengage your motors and prepared to be boarded." 

This was followed by a long string of regional control organizations, treaty clauses, and naval ranks by which the following sub conveyed its unshakable and inviolable authority to issue such a command. 

[//]: # (### They dive; Owen dies)

"Close the hatch Hemi," Percy said.

"I... I can not do that Sylvia," said Hemi.

"We're going to be under in seconds! This isn't a discussion." She climbed up two rungs on the ladder to the bridge, reached up and pulled the hatch down without looking up, cutting off the echoing voice on the loudspeakers explicating an ever-expanding description of pyramidal powers. 

She screwed the squeaking hatch-sealing wheel down tight. The light on the hatch-status board went from red to green.

More bits of lead smacked against the sail and along the hull of the _Prospect_ just below the waterline. Percy winced involuntarily again. There was no telling what kind of damage they could be doing. It might be nothing, or it might wound the _Prospect_ in just such a particular way that under exactly the right pressure of water, at some unknowable depth, the whole boat would collapse on itself.

"They're tearing us apart!" shouted Bastian.

Hemi fixed the small frames of his glasses in front of his eyes. "Do not worry. The boat will be safe from bullets underwater. Just get us down."

They could hear the water rushing up the hull and rising around them now as the sail went under the waves. 

Then they heard the tapping. 

Not the loud thunks of bullets, but the soft rhythmic bump of someone banging on the hull over their head. A few thumps evenly spaced, as if someone was putting all their strength into them. This was followed by a double-bump, which let them know for sure the source was not mechanical.

"Owen," said Hemi, his face blank.

"There's nothing we can do now," said Percy. The thumps went on for another few seconds. After a moment of silence, there were a few weaker ones. And then they stopped.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
 

[//]: # (But nobody _saw_ Owen die...)

Chips stood at the foot of the control room ladder looking up at Percy through the hatch. "Fuck you," she said softly. "The fuckin' judges in hell will fuck you for eternity for that, Percy." Chips turned and disappeared towards the stern of the boat.

Nobody else said anything. Percy spat. "Flood the fucking dive tanks!"

Hemi reached over to the tank trim panel and opened valves that let more water into the boat. Throughout the whole of the _Prospect_ huge volumes of water poured into the ballast tanks as air was displaced up pipes and vented out above them in streams of bubbles. Percy flipped the lights from white to red.

"Set the planes down steep," said Hemi, "full power to the electric motors. Drive us down as fast as possible." Gregory pushed the main throttles all the way forward, and the hum of the powerful electric motors rose up around them mixing with the sound of water rushing in to fill the boat. The rows of smaller dials showing the tank-fill statuses within their pitted chrome casings -- one with a cracked glass face -- all rose evenly and quickly.

The _Prospect's_ bow feel downwards ahead of them. Percy and Hemi grabbed the hanging leather straps and counter-angled themselves against the incline. The boat was going down fast enough that they could feel their stomachs rise against the descent.

The ship-to-ship radio lit up, and the communication from the pursuing sub continued where it had left off when Percy closed the hatch. "Diving submarine: you are ordered to discontinue your dive. Return to the surface and disengage your engines. If you do not, we _will_ launch a torpedo at you. Under the International Water Territorial Authority Control Agreement we are permitted to inspect any--" Percy punched the button cutting power to the ship-to-ship radio.

[//]: # (### Figuring out what the pursuing sub is going to do)

"If they want to sink us so bad, why didn't they just fucking torpedo us already?" Gregory asked.

"They were too close," Hemi replied. "They need to be at a minimum safe distance to fire without risking blowing themselves up. They probably also thought there was a chance they could capture our boat if we had been scared enough to just roll over."

"So we're not that scared?" asked Bastian. He put a cigarette to his lips for a long draw, not expecting a reply.

Percy sized up the situation. "It must have just been total bad luck for us. There's no way they could have tracked us down in that storm. ...Don't ya think Hemi?"

"It is incredibly unlikely. They may have just been riding out the storm themselves, and suddenly found they were on us."

"And that bad luck cost me a crew member," added Percy.

Hemi looked away and found himself analyzing the gauges. They had already achieved 30 meters of depth.

"Cassandra!" Percy yelled down to sonar through the hatch in the deck of the control room. "Stay on them! I need to know what they're doing." 

"I'm trying to Captain Percy." Cassandra responded, unable to hide the uncertainty in her voice. "I... I think they might be diving..."

Percy caught Hemi's eye. "What's their move Hemi? What are they trying to do?"

Hemi considered. "Well, if they are diving, I believe that suggests they want tactical mobility. On the surface, their opportunities to threaten us are extremely limited by the storm."

"Mmm hmm. By 'tactical mobility' you mean get in range to put a torpedo in the water that's pointed at us?" Percy asked.

"Our relative positions have barely changed. They are almost certainly still too close. But if we hear them turn away from us, we can assume they are trying to get enough distance to fire a torpedo. On the other hand, if they do not turn away, they may be lining up to try to ram us."

"Only a truly suicidal sub driver would try a ramming while submerged. There's too much risk of damaging their own boat beyond repair." 

"There is nothing to indicate that this commander is not suicidal..," said Hemi.

"Cassandra!" Percy called down again, "what's the range to the contact now?"

"Um.." Cassandra struggled, "I can't really tell Captain Percy. The background noise in the water is still so loud that it's making ranging very difficult."

"You had better go down there and get on the sonar with her," Percy said to Hemi.

Hemi nodded and slipped down through the hatch. He put one big hand gently on Cassandra's thin shoulder so he wouldn't surprise her -- she had her eyes closed and seemed to be concentrating very hard on listening. When he touched her she turned and opened her eyes and nodded to him. Hemi put the second sonar headset on.

A minute later he reported to Percy. "Sylvia, their diesels are off. They are definitely submerged. Range... maybe 300 meters. Hold on..."

The signal strength indicator rose slowly. Cassandra looked up at Hemi.

"They are increasing speed Sylvia. And turning... through our rear port quarter. They are going for distance. I assume to fire on us."

In the control room, Bastian overheard this report from Hemi. "Maybe they are turning to run away from us," he said to Gregory through the cigarette hanging from his lip.

Percy stood directly behind Bastian watching the depth gauge over his shoulder: 100 meters. "Push her down Bastian."

Bastian turned the dive plane control wheel to give the planes a steeper angle. Percy adjusted valves at the tank ballast control panel to give the bow even more weight.

"Hemi!" Percy said, "let me know immediately if they start to turn again."

"If they have rear torpedo tubes, they will not have to turn," Hemi replied. "And they are so close a torpedo will be in the water for only a minute before it hits us," he added.

Percy spat again. "Then let me know if there's any indication at all that they are about to fire Hemi."

"It is tough Sylvia. Cassandra is right, there is a lot of background noise."

Gregory reached up and wiped his sweating fingers on a rag hanging on the forward wall between the gauges. "I could never get used to going down fast like this, controlled or not," he said, as if voicing his fear might let some of it out from his guts and disperse it around the room a little. His eyes rapidly scanned over the stacks of dozens and dozens of dials and readouts on the front wall of the con. What Gregory read from those dials was that the sub was being put through the very limits of its endurable capabilities.  

The rising and falling needles on the dials, which usually moved with a deliberate and controlled slowness, were all rapidly chasing new positions. The RPM indicators for the electric motors were near red-line. The battery indicators were showing the batteries being drained so fast that Gregory could actually see the needles falling on the dials. The plane angle indicators were showing a steep angle. And the ballast tank status indicators were rapidly pushing towards a completely flooded boat. 

The depth indicator was the one that Gregory's eyes kept coming back to though. He had never seen it move so fast, showing him quantitatively what he knew from the lightened weight of his stomach: the _Prospect_ was a many-thousand-ton steel stone dropping through the water column.  It was hard to imagine what would stop the boat from simply winking out of existence in the never-ending blackness of the deepest parts of the ocean, crushed like distant matter pulled into a singularity. Within a few minutes it was passing through the range of 175 and 180 meters. 

[//]: # (### The sub with the ram fires a torpedo at them)

Everyone silently gripped their stations.

"They are turning Percy," said Hemi from the sonar station. He tapped a light rhythm on Cassandra's shoulder to draw her attention to a new unique sound in their headsets. "Sounds like they are flooding torpedo tubes!" 

A loud ping resonated from every piece of steel the boat had been built with. It hit broadside, and passed right through them. It rang off the opposite side of the _Prospect's_ hull and echoed back through the air to the crew's ears. At the sonar station, the ranging equipment lit up with the exact distance and direction of the pursuing sub. Hemi read the coordinates off the range display and relayed them to Percy. "That ranging ping of theirs puts them at 612 meters off our rear port side." 

"Now they have everything they need to fire on us," Percy said to herself.

Half a minute later Hemi heard the unmistakable sound of a torpedo being pressed out of its tube. "Torpedo in the water!"

Nobody said anything, instinctively listening to the space around them. After a few seconds the ping of the torpedo homing on the _Prospect_ started bouncing off the hull with the timed rhythm of a ticking clock.

"Take off your headset Cassandra," said Hemi, pointing at the range-finding equipment that lit up with the direction and remaining distance between them and the torpedo. It updated immediately following each ping -- the torpedo was gaining about 100 meters between each ping.

"Down. we have to get deeper," Percy whispered to herself in the control room. She reached past Bastian, and turned the dive planes wheel to the stop so they had maximum angle. The boat dropped from under them.

Where a moment before Gregory was fearing some unknown depth at which the _Prospect_ would cease to exist, now he felt himself squeezed in the jaws of a closing vise: between a torpedo that could blow the _Prospect_ open, and the pressure of water that could crush the boat flat.

Percy looked up. They were passing 200 meters. 

The torpedo's pings increased in frequency until they came so fast that they pulsed in the ears. The torpedo was on them.

And then there was a creeping silence in the moment where they had all expected the next sound to be their eardrums pressed in by the shock wave of an explosion.

There was nothing but a long lingering quiet. The only sound was the groaning of the _Prospect's_ hull being pushed through the continued stress of fast diving.

Gregory looked at Percy, "What happened?"

[//]: # (I do not think a torpedo has a pressurized hull, so it would not implode, it would just fail.)

"Most of the torpedoes on these Authority subs are older ones because they manufactured fuckin' huge numbers of them. They generally can't swim below 200 meters or so. The one homing on us probably just stopped functioning when critical components failed under the pressure." Percy paused, thinking to herself. "It's entirely possible that they are now loading a more modern torpedo into their tubes that can reach us at this depth, and all we've done is delayed the fuckin' inevitable."

Percy tilted her head slightly and said loudly, "what are they doing Hemi now?" 

Hemi and Cassandra had their headsets back on and were listening. "Sounds like they stopped moving Percy. They may have decided to wait us out," said Hemi.

[//]: # (### Hiding deep)

"OK," she said to Bastian and Gregory, "level us out. Hold us at this depth for the moment."

Bastian eased back the wheel on the dive plane while Gregory pulled the throttle back to the zero mark, and flipped some switches. The electric hum died away as the deck of the boat came up under their feet to something like level ground.  Bastian opened the valves controlling airflow to the ballast tanks, and a soft hissing whispered through the boat.  The ballast tank fill needles worked their way slowly back toward the middle marks on their dials. The depth gauge slowed and slowed, and then finally held level at 232 meters down.

The stress Captain Percy was feeling changed in character. A few moments before her mind was working quickly in the desperate survival mode of flight. Now that immediate pressure was off, replaced by an almost overwhelming cloud of slow and helpless dread as they switched to a mode of silent hiding and no further action could be taken. 

She looked around her in the crimson gloom. With the motors shut down her boat was completely silent. Their breathing loaded the air with dampness that condensed on the metal fixtures and gathered until it released a soft drip. The randomness of the dripping in the control room was maddening -- like it was irregularly marking time towards absolutely nothing. 

Bastian knew better than to ask, but Gregory did not, "what's our plan Captain?"

"Fuck Gregory! Let me think." She stared at the depth gauge, unblinking.

Bastian opened a valve on the tank trim control panel slightly further to make a minor adjustment to the level of the boat. Percy noticed his hand shaking as he reached out for the palm-sized control wheel.

Percy lit a cheroot and put it between her lips. "Do not make any moves." she said to Gregory and Bastian. She slowly climbed down the ladder to the sonar compartment. Half way down another ping from the sub with the ram bounced off the _Prospect's_ hull and rang through the crew's ears.

"They are 734 meters behind us, rear port quarter. They are at 150 meters deep," Hemi told Percy, reading off the ranging equipment. "Do you think they will fire another torpedo?"

Percy stepped over to the sonar console. "I think if they had a torpedo that could swim this deep they would have fired it already. No, I think they just want to be fucking sure we have not gone anywhere."

"They likely learned we are an unarmed boat at the depot as well," said Hemi, "they no longer have any fear of pinging us."

Percy nodded and thought. "Yes... but I wonder if they would be so quick to ping without a storm overhead. Right now they can reasonably assume there's no other Authority's craft around to hear them. If we can make our way out from under this storm, and into busier shipping channels, they might need to hide nearly as much as we do -- and lay off the fucking pings."

Cassandra took a rag hanging from a hook and wiped condensation off the sonar gauges.

Percy pulled Hemi over to the navigation chart. Hemi did not remove the sonar headset, instead stretching out the wire across the space between the sonar and navigation stations.

"We did OK charging the batteries on the surface during the storm. We have about a half charge on them," Percy said, as a starting point for managing all the variables they needed to weigh.

"So we can do a creeping speed for maybe 10 hours." Hemi did not express his opinion aloud that having 10 hours of charge, a somewhat luxurious electrical hoard considering their current situation, meant they could have, and maybe should have, submerged earlier -- and thus avoided the encounter with the _Grackle_. 

"OK. 3 knots, 10 hours. Let's see." Percy measured a compass against a graduated straight edge and then deftly spun the compass against the chart, drawing an arced dashed line with the grease pencil. "That gets us somewhere along this line."

Hemi nodded.

"Not very much in terms of ocean distances. We can probably get out from under the storm, but a long fucking way from any kind of shipping channel."

"Any other features we can use? A relatively shallow place we can hide on the bottom again, like the tablemount?" Hemi asked.

Percy took a long draft off her cheroot and then leaned closely over the chart. She pulled down the magnifier and sited her target through it with the tips of her fingers, holding the burning coal of the cheroot just off the glass. "There's nothing but fuckin' deep-sea. Bottomless for hundreds of miles in every direction."

"They are likely looking at the same chart and figuring they can simply wait out our batteries. They know we do not have a full charge since they caught us on the surface, and figure anything less than 20 hours comes out in their favor if they are patient about it," said Hemi.

"They might not be wrong." Percy stood upright and smoked. "Fuck it. Here's what we're going to fucking do: we're going to creep on a direct course towards Stilt City. If we can lose them, even briefly, we'll surface and try to get in touch with Shakes -- we'll launch the fuckin' pigeon." She waved her hand in the air in a way that might indicate a bird fluttering off.

"Herschel. And what if Herschel finds Shakes. Then what?"

"Have him run interference or something. Whatever the fuck it is we hired him for!"

Hemi looked grim.

"We need to get something between us and those fuckers up there, whether it's Shakes, other Authority craft, or some feature of the seascape. I just need something to hide my boat," said Percy, wracking her mind for options. "Gregory! Give us 3 knots."

The soft hum of the electric motors rose up through the silence.

"Hemi, can you stay on sonar?" Percy jerked a thumb towards Cassandra. "Let the kid get in the rack for a few hours."

Hemi nodded again. Cassandra heard Percy and looked at them with relief in her bloodshot saucer-eyes.

While Hemi took over for Cassandra, Percy climbed back up into the control room and had Gregory adjust their rudder so they were on a more direct route.

Ten minutes later another ping echoed through the hull, piercing through the quiet drone of the slowly-moving _Prospect_. Hemi quoted the distance and direction of the ping source to the control room. Percy ground her teeth. She willed the pursuers to get lost in the storm that still raged above.

The ping prompted Gregory to speak up again, "Captain Percy, don't you think we should try talking them into _not_ shooting at us? Someone over there must be a reasonable person and realize we are an unarmed cargo sub."

"The best-case scenario if we can convince them not to shoot is we have to let them aboard for an inspection," said Percy. "We aren't going to pass any inspections with our current cargo. And something tells me those guys aren't going be open to a bribe either..." She trailed off. "Besides, they are out of ship-to-ship range now -- probably trying to keep enough distance to fire a torpedo at us if we come back up above 200 meters.

They settled into an extremely low-speed chase. The _Prospect_ quietly hummed along through the deep -- beyond the depth in which it was designed to operate -- under 230 meters of water. The pursuing sub stayed closer to the surface but maintained the same distance behind them. The night was dragging on. With the glow of the red lights and the pervading and unchanging hum from the electric motors it did not take long for their fears to subside, to be replaced with sleepy routine.

But every 15 minutes, like a grating and persistent alarm, another reverberating ping broke through the silence. Each ping was always followed immediately after by Hemi's report from the sonar compartment that the pursuing submarine was maintaining nearly the exact same distance behind them. This he could, and did, tell Captain Percy with great precision.

Each new ping reset their anxiety. The eyes of the men at the controls would tear up and their hands would start shaking. The only relief was the passing of time, but that led inevitably towards the next alarm-ringing ping, and the cycle would start all over again.

[//]: # (middle of night: night 3, run to Stilt City)
And the cycle repeated itself without change for hours. The storm continued to spin above them, and their ears rang from the pings and from the silence between them. 

Cassandra showed back up in the sonar compartment, unable to sleep for the pings, and offered to sit at the sonar station again. When Hemi climbed into the control room, Percy had him relieve Gregory at the throttle controls and sent Gregory to make them a very late dinner.

Half an hour later Gregory's voice came over the PA saying food was ready. Captain Percy suggested Bastian and Cassandra should eat first, but Cassandra preferred to stay at sonar. Bastian offered to bring a plate of food up to her and sit at the sub controls while he ate. He was back from the galley in a matter of minutes with heaping bowls of steaming food for Cassandra and himself.

Percy held Bastian's bowl of food while he climbed the ladder to the control room. She realized how hungry she was as the smell wafted up to her nostrils.

"Bastian, sit at the planes controls and keep her at this depth and going the way we're going. If anything fucking changes, I'll be in the galley. Hemi, want to join me for food? Maybe we can come up with some kind of fucking plan."

"I am certainly ready to eat," said Hemi. 

Dinner was a white mush of crushed up hard biscuit mixed with water and fried with butter. Gregory had stirred in bits of dried salted meat, and was making a pan of scrambled eggs to accompany the mush with at least a little nutrition. He kept making more eggs -- in small batches, so at least they would be hot for the crew coming to eat.

Hemi and Percy loaded up bowls of the hot glop -- Hemi with twice as much as Percy -- and with two tin cups of coffee, sat down at the galley table. They ate in silence for a few minutes.

Hemi had let Herschel out of his cage as soon as the bird had come aboard, and Herschel had made his primary home in the _Prospect's_ galley, claiming any crumbs that made it to the deck. He wandered around their feet as they ate.

Another ping rang through the boat.

"Fuck!" said Percy.

"Hmm." said Hemi. "I am extremely curious as to why this particular boat is so persistent in pursuing us. Authorities often aggressively patrol their own waters, but the tension between them means they do not cross each other's lines. Almost always the reason any Authority craft might follow us over a long distance is simply because they have claimed new territory from another Authority, and we did not know it. In this case... I am fairly certain they have chased us from one Authority territory into another, yet they continue on."

"And it looks like they have every fucking intention of pursuing us into a third..."

"Do you think it is because they want to take this cargo we are hauling? Perhaps it is a strategic move for them: if we deliver, it undermines their position with another Authority somehow."

"No, I think it more likely that it is something along the lines of something Miss Mai said to me: it's possible someone put us on the prize list for privateers. And the Commander of the _Grackle_ -- with a privateer's warrant from some powerful Authority in his fist -- believes he is empowered to pursue us as a prize regardless of Authority borders."

"But surely whatever the warrant may _say_, other Authorities are not going to respect the rights of privateers to hunt us in their waters... seems like the _Grackle_ is taking an awfully large risk."

"I didn't put much stock in the suggestion myself at the time, for exactly that reason. But Miss Mai suggested it could be part of a bigger move, like some of the more powerful Authorities might _want_ to antagonize smaller and weaker ones. She made is sound like it could be the first step towards much bigger shifts, like perhaps some kind of collusion among the more powerful Authorities."

"They could carve up the world between them, if that's true."

"And take control of global shipping -- coordinated global shipping would eliminate the need for cargo submarines pretty fuckin' quick."

"So if we survive this run, we might soon be out of business."

"Well, those who play the game of global power lose as often as they win. Maybe we'll get lucky and the surface will end up _more_ dangerous and contentious because of this little experiment with privateers. That'll keep us in work for a good long fuckin' time."

"The more dangerous shipping is, the better our business. Perhaps I chose the wrong line of work."

"You could always retire to dry land and become a teacher Hemi."

Hemi lifted Herschel up to the table, balled up some leftover glop scrapings from his bowl, and tossed it onto the table in front of the pigeon. Herschel pecked at the glob nonchalantly.

[//]: # (### Chips comes in to tell them the bilge pump is broken)

Chips appeared in the hatchway to the galley. She caught Hemi's eye and ignored Percy. "Hemi, the fucking welds along the fucking crack in the cargo hold are weeping pretty fucking aggressively."

Percy's eyes followed Herschel.

"I am not surprised," Hemi replied, "running this deep is putting a lot more pressure on the hull, so I would expect more water coming in. Those welds were never going to be perfect. How bad is it?"

"Well, it would be no fucking problem," said Chips, "but one of the forward fucking bilge pumps has broke the fuck down. And the second forward pump isn't fucking keeping up. We're fucking flooding again."

"Can we fix the broken bilge pump?" Hemi asked.

"No fuckin' way. It's one of the fuckin' originals that came with the fucking boat -- decades old. The brushes on the pump motor are fucking shot."

Captain Percy suddenly remembered the pump motor in the depot hardware shop that she had neglected to purchase. She looked down at her bowl and scraped a together a spoonful of what remained. 

"Ah. Well..." Hemi turned heftily to look at Gregory, "Gregory, leave your eggs aside and go down to the cargo hold with Chips. Rig up one or two of the portable bilges to pump into the trim tanks. Hopefully that will hold us until we can come shallower."

"It's like we're right fucking back where we started with this fucking mess before we even did any fucking repairs!" said Chips. She turned towards the cargo hold without waiting for Gregory, who was a minute behind her after washing fry grease from his hands.

"Fuck Hemi," said Percy, "now we have another factor we need to be thinking about in the equation."

"You mean the leaking hull? Or that Chips cannot even look at you?"

"The fucking hull. I can't deal with Chips' fucking problems right now. We have a limited window -- that is, how long our batteries will hold out -- to find a way to lose these fuckers following us. I'm open to suggestions."

"We could try shutting down entirely -- maybe they will fly right over the top of us?"

At that moment another ping bounced through the hull of the _Prospect_.

Percy rolled her eyes. "That, of course, is why shutting down and hiding quietly won't work. There's no fucking way we will get out of range of active sonar at the rate we are moving."

"We could speed up, get them to match our speed, then shut down and let them shoot past," said Hemi. "That way they would be the ones moving out of range, and relieve us of the effort."

"How fast would we have to get them going so that they are out of sonar range by their next ping?"

"Assuming they keep pinging every 15 minutes..." Hemi did some quick calculations, touching his thumb to his forefinger as he counted. "Fairly fast. Perhaps 15 knots?"

"We'd use up the entire charge left on our battery in something like a quarter of an hour at that speed."

"It does indeed seem like this commander knows his tactics," said Hemi. "A less experienced sub driver would have made more mistakes. I do not see how we have any other option than to continue on our current course, and hope an opportunity presents itself."

"But it fucking kills me to have no plan Hemi."

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
 

[//]: # (### The scattering layer)

Percy and Hemi refilled their coffee cups and Hemi brought an extra one to Bastian in the control room, who gratefully accepted it into the long fingers of the hand that wasn't holding a smoldering cigarette. Hemi sat down in the planes control seat, and swiveled to review the tank ballast control panel. He made some small adjustments to the ballast to trim the boat more level -- probably to account for the water they were once again taking in through the poorly-welded gash in the pressure hull, he thought to himself.

[//]: # (After midnight: night 3, run to Stilt City)
Percy stayed below the control room in the sonar compartment with Cassandra still listening to the sonar. She confirmed with Cassandra that their situation had not changed at all, then stepped to the navigation table. She looked at the clock and then used a pair of calipers to measure against the ruler. She put the calipers to the chart, and marked down a single dash with the grease pencil to show the progress they had made in the last hour -- painfully small and slowly achieved progress.

The crew sank quickly back into the mired boredom of the chase. In the control room, Bastian lit one cigarette off another as he awkwardly tried to lean back in the control chair and put his feet up on the panel in front of him. Despite the casual repose, he was professional enough with his job that his eyes never left the gauges showing the status of the boat -- even though the array of dials and their indicating needles had not moved in any substantial way for hours on end.

The air thickened with smoke, became damp with the condensation of their breathing, and took on a shallow flatness after having been passed through carbon-dioxide scrubbers. The control room and sonar compartment felt hazy and wet. Hemi continually wiped water droplets from the ballast gauges with a grimy cotton rag.

[//]: # (very late night: night 3, run to Stilt City)
Hours passed. Hemi and Bastian would try to start conversations with with each other, instinctively knowing that talking was a way to keep alert. But the thick atmosphere, red lighting, and the grinding drone of the motors continually laid down over their conversations, stifling like a fire blanket. And precisely every 15 minutes there was the piercing ping from their pursuers that reoriented their attention and their fear.

At some point Gregory returned to the control room from below and reported that the portable bilge pumps seemed to be overcoming the water oozing in through the welded seam, and they no longer had to worry about sinking -- for the moment. Gregory took over the plane control seat from Hemi, while Hemi reminded him to keep an eye on the ballast tank they were pumping bilge water into since it would need to be blown out at some point.

With Gregory back in the control room, Percy put the crew on rotating half hour breaks. "You're each in the rack for two pings from those fuckers up there," She said to them. 

Hemi took over sonar from Cassandra and sent her off first. He was somewhat concerned about how well she could hold up under the strain of these many hours without sleep, though she protested from behind big watering eyes that she was fine.

Putting on the sonar headset, Hemi could tell immediately that the storm had subsided quite a bit. Cassandra had failed to report that the white noise coming down from the storm-stirred surface above had greatly diminished in the last couple of hours. It was understandable, especially for someone new to sonar -- the change had been gradual enough that it was easy for someone listening to it in an unbroken stream to not notice it had changed at all. A very experienced sonar operator would have noted the change on the signal strength gauge. But it was also apparent to Hemi simply because he was listening with fresh ears.

Still, a reduced storm did not change their situation much in empty seas. Scanning around carefully, Hemi did not hear any other contacts, or much of anything really. The ocean was getting quieter. At some point the pursuing sub might stop pinging simply because they could possibly pick out the quiet hum of the _Prospect's_ motors in the silent ocean.

Another ping smacked against the _Prospect's_ hull. But this one sounded immediately distinctive to Hemi. He heard the ping as it rang the boat, but then he heard it again in his headset just a split second later, bouncing back up as if they had been pinged a second time from below. His head immediately swiveled to look at the ranging equipment.

"Sylvia!" he called up to her, "that ping just echoed off the bottom -- just a hundred meters or so below us."

"That's fucking impossible Hemi, there's nothing but deep water..." In the control room she was looking at the depth-under-keel gauge, which suddenly in the wake of the ping had stood up from the 'bottomless' pin and was now showing just 96 meters. She watched the gauge and it was slowly, slowly rising, like a gentle slope coming up under them.

Percy lit a cheroot and stared at the gauges.

"Another tablemount?" Bastian asked.

"No..." said Percy, "this came out of nowhere, it's something fucking weird..." She hung her weight from a strap above her, and leaned over Bastian as she smoked, watching the depth-under-keel gauge slowly rise. "Give us a little more speed Bastian; 10 knots." 

Bastian eased the throttle forward and the hum of the motors doubled in volume.

"Sylvia," Hemi said from the sonar station below as he listened to the increased noise of the _Prospect_ in his headset, "at this speed they can definitely follow us on passive sonar without pings."

"Noted Hemi, thank you." Her eyes focused on the depth-under-keel gauge, it rolled back ever so slowly and then it crossed the 20 meter mark. Percy slammed her closed fist against the dive alarm. "Gregory, full down plane, right now."

Gregory turned the dive plane control wheel, spinning the polished stainless wheel through his fingers quickly until it hit the stop. The bow of the _Prospect_ dropped from under them, and the depth-under-keel gauge fell rapidly towards zero. The depth from the surface gauge started climbing quickly in the opposite direction, from 235 to 240, to 245 meters deep.

"Gregory, open the main ballast valves." Percy said.

"We're dropping awfully fast Captain, if we open main ballast we're going to hit the bottom and split apart!"

"Sweet fucking hell! Obey your captain's orders -- it's the oldest fucking rule on the sea." She reached over Gregory to the ballast tank control panel and rolled open the main ballast valves herself. They could hear a rush of air escaping above as water flooded into the main ballast tanks from below. 

It was a sound they heard all the time, but at this depth it reminded Gregory how unique this sound was to submarines -- on any other ship it was the sound of death. In this particular case he was not convinced it would not also be the sound of the _Prospect's_ death, at the hands of a captain who had snapped under the strain of days without sleep and on a constant edge of terror.

After hours spent staring at the wall of dials in front of him, with little black needles stubbornly refusing to move, suddenly it seemed like all the dials were climbing or falling -- all in a directions that communicated nothing but doom for the boat. The depth was rapidly increasing, their speed was increasing, the ballast tanks were filling with water, and the bottom -- Gregory could see it in his head: black and thick, gooey enough that the boat might sink meters into it, yet hard enough that it might break the _Prospect's_ spine when it hit. The bottom was simply flying up at them. Perspiration ran freely down Gregory's temples.

Bastian quietly wrapped his long fingers around the throttle control, ready to yank it back to reverse the motors... he willed the command to be given. His other hand reached out in front of him and pressed palm-forward against the steel of the console, in a near-subconscious gesture to brace himself.

Captain Percy stood behind them, one arm slung above her with her wrist twisted into the overhead strap. Her other hand held the cheroot, aflame, with a long thin string of smoke rising upwards at a slant angle relative to the orientation of the control room in the steeply diving boat. She stared at the depth-under-keel gauge.

Seconds later that gauge tapped the zero pin. 

Gregory and Bastian winced, waiting for the breaking, popping shudder that would be what the end of the _Prospect_ felt like.

Another second after that, the gauge spun wildly and pegged itself against 'bottomless' on the other side of the dial. It flipped over with such force that Gregory could hear the hair-tap of the needle against the pin in the quiet of the control room. The depth gauge next to the depth-under-keel gauge continued to rise steadily past 250 meters.

The _Prospect_ let out a long low groan that tortured every surface of the boat.

[//]: # (### Hiding under the scattering layer)

"Level her off!" said Percy. She had calmly and confidently driven her ship through the false bottom, but now they were up against the very limits of the depths the boat was capable of. A few more seconds of descending, and they would fall unstoppably into the hole, and never see the surface again.

Bastian immediately yanked the throttle into reverse, and Gregory spun the dive plane control wheel around in the opposite direction to steer the bow back upwards with one hand while at the same time he twisted close the main ballast valve switches on the tank control panel with the other.

The engineers who designed the _Prospect_ intended the boat to operate normally down to 215 meters. But Percy had pushed the boat beyond that many times, and despite the age of the boat had full confidence in its ability to withstand 250 meters of depth -- though she generally only tested that confidence in an emergency. Beyond that was the mystery of the death zone. The original engineers anticipated full collapse of the boat at 300m. But terrible things could happen in that range between 250 and 300 meters that they were passing into at the moment.

Every 10 meters further down added another atmosphere of pressure to the hull. The equivalent of another entire column of the weight of the air on the surface pressing down from space. And against that had to stand the measly one atmosphere of pressure inside the _Prospect_, reinforced with the strength of the steel pressure hull. On a boat 100 meters long like the _Prospect_, in a steep dive like this, the bow could easily already be under an entire atmosphere more pressure than what the depth gauge (that measured from the sail) was showing Percy. A small adjustment in the wrong direction of the huge planing fins that guided the sub up or down, or one valve accidentally left partially open and flooding a ballast tank, could take them down in a matter of seconds the last critical meters beyond what the boat could stand. Percy knew they were within meters of crossing that unknowable line where critical parts of the _Prospect_ would fail, and they would never get the boat to rise again.

The _Prospect's_ motors were spinning the propeller in reverse now, pulling hard against the fall of the boat.

"Watch the forward speed Bastian!" Percy warned, "if we start moving backwards with the dive planes set like that, you'll swing the bow deeper instead of shallower. Don't let her reverse direction."

"On it Cap," said Bastian, his eyes watching the speed gauge. With full reverse thrust, it was rapidly falling towards zero, but they still had enough forward momentum that the bow was slowly rising. As soon as their speed came below a single knot, Bastian pushed the throttle into neutral. The bow had come up almost level at this point.

The climb of the depth gauge had slowed dramatically, and was now only barely moving -- but still moving -- higher and deeper.

"The ballast!" yelled Percy. She stepped to the tank control panel and flipped switches and spun open a selection of the dozen or so small valve control wheels in front of her. There was a hiss of air from deep in the boat as the high pressure system blew water out of some of the trim tanks. The boat came back to almost completely level. Percy continued to work the tank ballast panel, pushing air back into the main ballast.

The depth gauge came to a slow stop at 263 meters.

Hemi climbed up from sonar. He looked at the depth. "New record?" he asked as his eyes found Percy's.

"Nope. But a close fucking second. I had her down to 267 once." 

As if to remind Percy of the stress it was currently bearing, the _Prospect_ let a another slow groan rise from the guts of the boat. "My poor girl," said Percy. "Sorry baby, we'll take some of the fucking weight off soon."

"What happened back there?" asked Gregory. "I thought we were going to hit the bottom for sure." 

"False bottom," said Percy. "The deep scattering layer -- billions and billions of tiny bony fish come up from the depths in the night to feed -- such a fucking mass of them together that they reflect sonar back up, making them look like the bottom. We swam right through them, and came out underneath."

"Just when you think submarining is fucking boring..." said Bastian.

Another ping from the pursuing submarine hit the _Prospect_, but this time it had a different quality to it -- not just less powerful, but also diffuse and muted, as if it were coming from much further away than the last ping.

"So... they can't see us now because of the layer of fish between us and them?" Gregory asked.

"With any luck their active sonar is nothing more than a damned fish-finder now," Percy replied. "And we'll just keep ourselves very quiet for a few minutes here."

"Maybe I should go back to my bunk then?" Cassandra asked, looking up at Percy from the compartment below, having returned from her short and harrowing break.

Another muted ping rang through the _Prospect_.

"I don't think they are going to let you sleep Cassandra," said Percy. "Can you get back on sonar and see if you can figure out what their next move is?"

"Sure Captain Percy," Cassandra said before flopping into the sonar station chair.

A few seconds passed and another ping rang out.

"They have lost us," said Hemi. "Now they are searching."

The gaps between the pings became an irregular few seconds.

"Cassandra, can you tell what they're doing?"

"They've got their motors going -- pretty loud." Cassandra listened for another second as a ping passed through them. "They're moving at a good clip... It sounds like they're starting to turn in a circle?"

"Starting a search pattern," said Hemi.

"And they're moving quickly and loudly because they are relying on active sonar. I think I might go so far as to describe it as somewhat fucking desperate in character too. They've definitely lost us," Percy added.

"So when do we make our move? Can we sneak away?" asked Hemi.

"Go down to navigation and start tracking them from their pings. We'll move when they are furthest from us."

"OK." Hemi moved down to the navigation table. For the next 15 minutes every time he heard a ping from the _Grackle_ he looked at the ranging equipment on the sonar and marked down the searching sub's precise location on the chart. Some of his dots were wildly off in random directions because the deep scattering layer was interfering with the ranging equipment. But the sub with the ram sent out so many active pings that Hemi was able to chart a accurate course of their movement. It was a circle that began where the _Prospect_ had dropped through the deep scattering layer, and turned in a miles-long arc away from that point.

"Percy," Hemi called up to the control room as the latest ping showed their pursuers at nearly 5 nautical miles away, "it looks like they are at the apogee of their search arc. Now might be a good time to move."

[//]: # (### They run under the scattering layer)

"Thanks Hemi. Keep plotting them," she called down. "Can you also give me a random course in some direction away from them? True fuckin' random, if you can."

"One moment." Hemi pulled a book off the shelf above the navigation table that contained nothing but a million random numbers, plus instructions for selecting one of the numbers at random. Hemi looked at the chart and estimated about a dozen possible directions they could move that would take them away from the sub with the ram. Then he used the book to select a random number which he transposed into one of his dozen courses. "Here's a true random bearing Sylvia: 163 degrees."

"OK Bastian, make it 3 knots, come about to 1-6-3."

Bastian shifted the throttle slight forward and the speed needle lifted slowly up off its zero pin. He turned the rudder wheel and the boat leaned slightly into the turn.

"Keep her fuckin' level Gregory -- we're too deep to make any mistakes," said Percy.

Gregory gave a gentle nudge to the bow plane control wheel so the boat would come up just a hair with the new forward momentum on it.

They cruised slowly and silently away from the spot where they had crossed the deep scattering layer. The pings from the sub with the ram quickly got more and more faint, though they could still hear them bouncing softly off the _Prospect_ long after Cassandra reported that she could not hear the _Grackle's_ motors any more.

Percy stood directly behind Gregory, carefully double checking his every move to make sure they did not accidentally sink below the boat's crush depth. After an hour, she personally relieved Gregory in the dive plane control seat and sent him to his rack for a break.

At 3 knots the _Prospect's_ motor made just enough noise that with the right filters in place on sonar, Hemi could hear the echo of the Prospect off the deep scattering layer above them. He showed Cassandra what to listen for, and pretty soon she could give a rough estimate of their depth below the mass of fish. It stayed above them for more than 2 hours, but then Cassandra told Percy she could hear it coming slowly down on top of them -- the fish were beginning their daily vertical migration back down the water column to the safety of the very deep, far below the capabilities of the _Prospect_. 

[//]: # (dawn: day 4, run to Stilt City)
At the depth they were still cruising at, near the very limits for the _Prospect_, the boat continually let out long moans as the steel of the hull flexed under the weight of the water and stresses of movement. The sounds had a visceral impact on Captain Percy, as if her child were suffering. So it was with a sense of relief that they passed back through the mass of fish as the school descended. Once they were back above the scattering layer, there was no purpose to staying so dangerously deep, so Percy adjusted the bow planes and the _Prospect_ rose to a much more comfortable 200 meters of depth.

When Gregory came back from his break, Percy stepped down the ladder to the sonar compartment and joined Hemi at the navigation table.

[//]: # (### They come up in a fog bank)

"Our next challenge," said Hemi as she stepped up to the lighted chart, "is how long the batteries will last."

"Don't think for a second that isn't front of my mind," said Percy. "Coupla hours left, at best. Then we have to surface. And it's fucking daylight now -- barring another storm, we'll be bright targets -- both visual _and_ radar -- for those fuckers with the ram. They'll be back on us before we can get the ballast tanks fully emptied."

"We could wait it out until nightfall without moving. We have enough power to keep the lights on at least."

"I'm worried we haven't put enough distance between for that. If they find us running on the surface, at least we can try to outrun them. If they find us deep with no battery when they come back around on their next search circle, we're done for."

"We would benefit from another piece of covering luck like the deep scattering layer," said Hemi.

"That maneuver depended far too much on luck and a dangerous roll of the dice, Hemi. Luck and gambling is no way to run a submarine. The odds are never in our favor. What I want is a fucking plan that is reliable and executable." She paused, feeling tired. "Fuck me," said Percy. "I'm going to lay down for a minute. Run the batteries down, and get me when we have only emergency reserves left."

Percy climbed down a deck and disappeared forward into the Captain's cabin. She was out almost immediately as she fell into her rack. The ability to fall asleep instantly was a talent she had gained from long years of experience working with short sleep on subs.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
 

[//]: # (early morning: day 4, run to Stilt City)
They motored nearly silently though the black depths for another two hours before the battery depletion warning lights lit up on the electrical system panel in the control room. Hemi had his deck crew shut the motors down and keep the boat hovering steadily in place while using as little power as possible. He went down to the Captain's cabin and woke Percy. They returned to the sonar compartment together, updated their probable position on the chart -- still a long way from anywhere -- and decided to take the only reasonable action available to them: rise to periscope depth and have a look around.

Not wanting to waste battery power driving up to the surface, they opened the high-pressure air system just a bit on the main ballast tanks to gain a little buoyancy and floated upwards. They watched the depth gauge rotate back to the left making its way steadily towards zero. At periscope depth, Hemi flooded enough of the trim tanks to hold them there. Percy put the scope up.

"Holy fuck, Hemi," she said quietly, with her eyes in the viewport of the periscope. She rotated around the periscope, swinging it around 360 degrees, as every submarine pilot is trained to do their first day using a periscope. In every direction she was faced with a gray wall, that occasionally pushed back to reveal an underlayer of a slate-colored ocean -- much calmer now -- rising and falling with the long frequency of deep ocean swells. "Would you fucking believe our luck is still with us? We have a thick fog bank. In every direction."

Hemi smiled. "Makes sense -- it was likely a big warm wall of air pushing that storm, and now all that hot air is sitting on the surface of the cold ocean, turning into cloud."

"Alright! So much for needing a fucking plan! Start up the low-pressure compressors, and put us on the surface."

Hemi flipped some switches on the ballast control panel and the hum of compressors vibrated up from far below deck. The _Prospect_ rose in place until the deck of the boat pushed through the tightly-bound tension of the surface and water washed off and over the curved sides.

Hemi opened the hatch of the control room and climbed up to the bridge followed closely behind by Captain Percy. The air on the bridge was warm and wet. It sat on the surface of the water without moving, and left droplets forming rapidly on the woolly fabric of Hemi and Percy's clothes. The fog was the color of purgatory, lit from somewhere far off above them to a flat dim nothingness. At some moments it was so thick they could not see beyond the top of the sail, and at others it pushed back just enough to see down to the bow of the boat.

A blinding fog was not a challenge for a submarine though -- which spent most of its time moving sightlessly through the pits of the world anyway -- but a useful resource, transforming the surface into a similar dense covering medium as the deep ocean.

Percy called down to Bastian to start the engines, push the boat up to its maximum surface speed of 15 knots, and come around to a direct course for Stilt City. A moment later came the loud hiss and roll of the high-pressure air system turning over the diesel engines until they were firing on their own. The exhaust shutters lifted and let out a stream of black froth into the gray fog from the rear end of the sail. A minute later Bastian engaged the motors and Percy felt a jolt as the _Prospect_ picked up speed.

[//]: # (### They launch Herschel)

"Welp." Percy said to Hemi above the noise of the diesels. "I guess it might be time to launch the pigeon."

"Herschel."

"'Herschel.'" Percy repeated. "Do you think that little fella will be able to find Shakes in this fuckin' fog?"

"He has a better chance in this fog than he would have if we had sent him up into that storm. Though the truth is I am fairly skeptical about Shakes' claims that Herschel can find a boat on the surface of the ocean. My understanding of homing pigeons is that they know instinctively how to fly home -- I am not sure that works if 'home' is a moving target."

"Shakes said the pigeon had special training."

"It would have to be exceptionally special."

"So we might just be sending the bird off to die on the fucking ocean?" For the first time Percy's face showed concern about the small animal.

"If I thought that, I would not send Herschel out. The other thing I have heard about homing pigeons is they are capable of flying extraordinary distances. I am confident Herschel will eventually find some place to land. I am just not convinced we will ever see him again. Of course I am not entirely convinced we will ever see Shakes again either."

"OK Hemi, if you think the bird will be alright, and there's a chance it will help us reconnect with Shakes, let's launch him."

"What shall the message say?"

"I noted on the chart the dock in Stilt City where we're supposed to drop the cargo. I guess we're close enough that at this point, you should should just give him the dock info, and that our expected arrival is 24 hours or so from now. We'll meet him there, if it's at all fucking possible."

"Alright," said Hemi. "I will be back in a few minutes with Herschel."

Percy watched Hemi's wet, tweed-covered bulk disappear down the ladder and through the hatch into the control room. She lit a cheroot and took in deep breaths of damp, smokey air. A sudden wave of exhaustion passed through her.  She looked at her hands gripping the fairing of the sail -- the black grime of her work ground into the seams of her knuckles and the cheroot smoking between her fingers. The coal of the tobacco glowed robustly now that the _Prospect's_ movement was pushing some wind across it. She'd had only a few hours of sleep and no relief from the tension of being pursued since they left the depot days ago. The warm fog enveloped her and gave her a sense of cover and safety that she realized now she had missed and desperately needed.

Hemi reappeared on the bridge of the sail, cupping Herschel in one big hand as he awkwardly climbed the ladder. The bird looked quite content. One of Herschel's feet hung out through Hemi's fingers and had a small steel band with an even tinier cylinder attached to it. Percy instantly had a vision of how a few moments ago huge Hemi must have been hunched over the galley table printing extremely small letters with a very sharp pencil on a short roll of thin paper. She regretted missing that.

"OK," said Hemi. "Herschel is ready to go."

Percy watched him. "So... do you have to give the bird any instructions or anything?"

"Assuming Shakes is right about Herschel's training, all we have to do is throw him up in the air."

Percy nodded.
