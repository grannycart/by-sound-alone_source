## 1. Tablemount


[//]: # (### Opening scene --- night on a black dead calm sea)

The weight of the atmosphere pressed the night down on the ocean. The air above the black water was pinned under a murky dome of heavy cloud, held down like a dying songbird gripped in the claws of some great hunting feline. The weight compressed the air to complete stillness, flattening the water until it was unable to raise more than a barely perceptible heave, forced up from the hidden reserves of power somewhere deep below the glassy surface. 

A distant moon --- cast out by the atmosphere and not visible --- dimly lit the clouds to the color of the charred edges of a coal. The moon reclined, above and beyond, unable to muster enough warmth to intervene with the iron grip of the atmospheric pressure. It merely stood by helplessly, feebly attempting to stir the ocean out from under the strong arm of the atmosphere by the force of tide. It was all it could do to provide even the coldest, dimmest light. That light filtered down through layer upon layer of gray cloud until it was so diluted and refracted that it left the sky only a few shades of black lighter than the water. 

[//]: # (Nature is deliberately malevolent. Humans are randomly malevolent.)

The ocean below was unquestionably black. The blackness had risen up from the deep. Out beyond the atmosphere rode heavenly bodies that radiated light and heat, and the thick gasses of the atmosphere carried some portion of that warmth down to the surface. But in the deep there is darkness and cold, and the viscous liquid transported that darkness up to the surface, carried on vast swells of cold. As hard as the atmosphere might press down, the darkness yielded not at all to the pressure above.

The boundary where the black water met the pale air stretched from horizon to horizon along the cupped edge of the dome of cloud, without referent or feature. Until a point arose. A point like the first push of a needle through the underside of a new piece of fabric, the workings of which would soon bond the fabric to another with hundreds of interwoven and gradually tightening stitches. The point rose, a long thin wire extruded up, piercing through the surface. A weak V-shaped wake trailed behind it in the water, marking its course. The tip of the wire wavered in the thick air, describing great arcane gestures that were transmitted up its length and amplified from the chaos of forces afflicting its still-submerged lower reaches.

The base of the wire emerged, mounted atop a short mast that followed the wire up through the surface, and soon after accompanied by a series of a half dozen or so other masts, each adding a new wake behind it. The line of wakes carved up the black surface behind the path of the masts with their nested Vs. For a minute they moved alone on the surface, and the Vs grew longer and longer, stretching out behind in a subtle but ever-widening trail.

A black oblong pushed through the surface and rose into the air. Water streamed across the flat top and down the smooth metal sides of the oblong. It grew upwards, like a rising column of soot from a factory, and became a curved vertical wall. It thrust up against the pressure of the atmosphere just as seismic forces raised up a new continent. Water shot in streams from vents in the side of the walls, draining out interior voids that had been filled while submerged. The curved wall sprouted up from a giant body at its base, which now broke through the surface, lifting the wall farther into the air above. An enormous flat deck was called into existence along the top of the body, appearing in a long line ahead of the curved wall of the oblong. The sea water washed back and forth across the deck, the pressure of the atmosphere finally yielding to irresistible forces generated by a machine made by humans.  Water ran from the deck and down the curved sides of the body which contained huge tanks that moments before had been filled with water. Now buoyant air displaced the water, raising the deck upwards. The surface of the black ocean gave before the breach of this leviathan, and a wake of dull gray broke out behind it.

At first its movement was nearly silent, other than the sound of the water running along its sides and the soft crash of the curling wake left behind. Then it coughed, spat, and from two pipes that opened at the top of its oblong dorsal fin two arcs of flame burst orange into the surrounding night, spraying apocalyptic color across the landscape of pitch. The flames flashed over the reflective blackness of the water and bounced back from the low clouds, and then died back into the dens from which they came. They left behind the rolling churn of exploding diesel and hot air pouring up through the pipes and forcing open the shutters that normally protected them from the influx of water.

The engines of the machine revved up and then maintained a loud high pitch, generating the energy to drive it forward through controlled and contained combustion trailed by blowing heat. The surfaced submarine accelerated, reached, and maintained an unvarying speed.

Set into the top of the dorsal fin was a recessed platform. At the bottom of the platform was a black well of a hole that led further down into the fin.

At the bottom of this well, a rusty wheel turned and creaked. A crescent moon of red light split the black well bottom and widened into a perfect circle as a hatch lifted open. The shadow of a small figure climbed through it and up a short metal ladder to stand upright on the recessed deck platform. This smaller first shadow was followed by another much larger shadow. Both figures looked around at the darkness. A darkness of pitch, except for the red glow rising dimly from below their feet. They leaned forward and rested against the fairing. The smaller figure made some gestures to the darkness, and a match light glowed against the end of a stubby roll of tobacco.

The glowing coal swept a thin line in front of them as an arm opened to the darkness. The figure next to her, dwarfing her in size, just nodded. There was no need to describe the all-consuming blackness aloud.

The giant figure slowly pulled his fingers through his thick beard. "Perfect night for a surface run." 

"Perfect night for contemplating your doom, Hemi," said the smaller figure.

"If darkness stirs up feelings of doom, then wear your doom like a blanket."

"It's probably best if you keep your imaginative comparisons to yourself. After all, a blanket is for warmth --- our doom is unlikely to be very warm."

"Perhaps so." Hemi paused breathing in the dense smell of the burning tobacco; there was no reason to rush anything this night. "The usual plan for tonight then?"

"Same as every other fucking night. Charge up the batteries --- run on the surface 'til the light cracks the sky, and then we'll disappear back where we came from. Make sure you keep those pissants at the controls awake though."

Hemi put one huge hand on her shoulder and turned to climb down through the hatch. She pulled on her cigarillo and the coal at the tip glowed in the darkness. Her doom would probably eventually be a doom of freezing water, she knew that, but at least tonight it was warm enough to be out in the open, up on the top of her boat. The blackness lay on it, and she did indeed find some comfort in that: nobody could see them. If she controlled all the levers of the universe, her vessel would never be seen.

[//]: # (### They get rammed by a black sub)

Captain Sylvia Percy stayed on the bridge of her submarine's sail for hours, smoking her way through one cigarillo after another and watching the empty nothingness go by while her thoughts spiraled outward without direction. For a long time she was surrounded by an environment disturbingly deprived of sensory input. The diesel engines were loud enough, but unvarying. So too the vibration that the engines sent up through the steel-grated deck to shake the worn rubber of her boot soles without change in frequency or amplitude. The blackness around her was limitless, though the boat pushed relentlessly forward. It occurred to Percy that when her boat, the _Prospect_, was submerged this is what it must be like outside: featureless dark. It felt like she had loosed the bonds of her corporeal body and had floated beyond it, so she could experience what her boat was like when it was pushing through the icy blackness of an alien world where the pressure would collapse any body that had evolved for comfort on the surface into a unrecognizable pulp of hemoglobin and fats.

As with many things that seem interminable, the slow but persistent forward motion eventually forced the dome of clouds to relent. The submarine pushed through to crawl out under a sky of stars and a weak, low moon. Captain Percy could now see her hand holding her latest cigarillo, and the long shadow of the _Prospect_ stretching out ahead, parting the waters to allow her to pass as she rode astride this beast of hers. This was a pure and rare pleasure on a submarine, where she spent the vast majority of her time in a steel tube, staring at the same set of dials, with few opportunities to focus her eyes on anything beyond a meter in front of her.

Percy knew her boat well. She had spent enough time with it to have internalized its movements. She almost always knew what the boat was doing just by the feeling of it --- the angle of the deck, the vibrations of the engines or the electric motors, the subtle changes to the pressure of the air. Even at depth --- when the hull and struts of the boat groaned under the weight of the water above --- to her the sounds of the boat under pressure felt like the normal sounds of a huge human taking a great weight onto its shoulders. The only time she ever worried was when the _Prospect_ conveyed sounds or motions, or some other input, that she could not recognize. She had been through so much with this boat that it was only when it did something new that she got scared.

It was when the _Prospect_ had moved fully out from under the clouds, and everything was lit to a dull blue by the moon, that she felt something new. A collection of haptic feedback to her senses made panic rise in her chest. The boat shuddered, as if the cold water it swam through all these years had finally chilled its core. 

Percy was thrown violently against the fairing.

She immediately dropped to her knees on the deck of the bridge, pushed her short fingers through the gaps in the steel grating, and gripped. She stuck her head over the hatch hole and looked down to see Hemi's large face looking up at her from a couple of deck-heights below.

"I don't know!" he yelled before she could ask. She could hear him haranguing the deck crew to kill the diesel engines and reverse the propellers.

The bow of the _Prospect_ had come to a dead stop, but the stern still had forward motion. Percy could feel the whole boat turning unnaturally around its center axis, like part of an experiment by some precocious child: a magnetized pin through a cork floating in a bowl of water, pulled around by the invisible forces of a planetary aura. 

The deck under her began to lean to the starboard side. Percy propped one foot against the inside of the bridge well wall. The boat listed sickeningly. She got to her feet, still braced against the angle of the boat. The pads of her fingers gripped the sharp rusted edges of the fairing, and she peered out over it into the night, scanning for what they had hit. The water to the starboard side remained black and calm, though not quite as glassy as it had been earlier in the night. They were far from shore, in fairly well-charted though little-trafficked waters. The _Prospect_ had clearly run into something at full surface speed, but there should have been nothing to hit here.

For a few moments the boat hung at an angle with no motion and all potential. And then it began to right itself, tilting slowly back towards the port side. As the edge of the fairing came down, Percy could see more of the sea off to port, and there appeared the shadowed silhouette of another submarine. 

The bow of the other boat rose up out of the water first, revealing one of the rarest things seen on a modern submarine: a distinguishing feature. The bow had a jagged point that swept back in long sharp blades to merge incongruously into the soft curves of the submarine's hull. Curved teeth sprouted all along the blades, and these had been reinforced with welded crossbars in many more places than could possibly be necessary. A medieval-looking device intended for ramming ships. Percy had never seen anything like it. It must be both a noisy and inefficient thing for a sub to push through the water ahead of it. Efficiency and quiet were normally the top priorities for a submarine's design.

Behind the snags of the bow ram came the smoothly swelling curve of a black military submarine. It came up from the surface with water streaming slickly down its sides. The sail rose above with dive planes mounted to it, sticking out like small wings and set at an angle to raise the sub quickly. When the stern finally broke the surface, it was mere meters away from Percy, its swirling wake washing white up against the side of the _Prospect_. 

"Might be our fucking doom a lot sooner than we anticipated," Percy said to herself as she climbed down through the hatch and the red crescent of light waned out of existence behind her.

[//]: # (### They crash dive)

She hung on the metal rungs of the ladder just under the hatch set in the ceiling of the cramped control room of her submarine, and with one hand quickly screwed shut the squeaking wheel of the hatch seal before dropping to the deck. Hemi looked down at her through his small-framed spectacles.

"Down." She gave the one-word command as she pushed the button on the wall that activated the dive alarm. 

"Give me full speed forward," said Hemi. He put one large hand on each of the shoulders of the two men who sat at the controls of the sub and instructed them to dive the boat. One of these men was a stick-figure of a man who went by the moniker Bastian. The other, "Handsome" Gregory, had a meaty square forehead that looked like a miniaturized version of his meaty square torso. Of the two of them, only Gregory looked like he belonged on a submarine.

Diving the sub required delicacy even in the calmest circumstances. Now Hemi and the two men at the controls carefully timed their movements. Their eyes scanned continually over the wall of dials, gauges, switches, and valves in front of them that reflected the red glow of the night lighting. This wall at the front of the control room told them the _Prospect_'s angle, depth, speed, systems settings, battery charge --- the whole picture of the boat's orientation and movement. Indeed, this wall, plus some of the panels situated to their right and left, was the _only_ way to know the status of the boat while it was submerged.  

Gregory and Bastian made adjustments according to Hemi's instructions, choosing carefully which of the dozens of valves to open or close, or which switches to flip on or off. The submarine let out a long exhale: the air that had held it aloft on the surface being pressed out by an onrush of water from below into the flooding tanks.

"Flood the express dive tank," said Hemi, his voice low since the tiny space of the control room did at least make it easy to hear one another.

"Right, Boss." Bastian reached up and opened a valve and water thrust through thick old pipes into the deepest parts of the bow of the boat. The forward part of the boat pitched steeply downwards in response. Percy reached to grab cracked leather loops that hung overhead. She angled her feet against the incline and her eyes followed the needle of the depth gauge. 

The ship-to-ship radio above Percy's head lit up. From the radio's speaker a recorded voice began blatting a warning that they were violating the territorial waters of someone they had never heard of, who was authorized by a series of treaties with titles that became acronyms that became words that contributed to further acronyms. The recording concluded by ordering all submerged submarines to surface and prepare to be boarded. 

Percy punched the mute button on the radio.

"Only on the surface do these fucking territories and treaties matter," she said.

Hemi nodded.

"What the fuck happened up there?" Gregory asked, his eyes never leaving the wall of dials and gauges in front of him.

"We were hit. Sub with a big ugly ram mounted on the front of it. Totally fucking insane thing for a submarine to have," said Percy.

"Possibly some specialty-built Authority enforcer boat." Hemi sounded unconvinced by his own hypothesis.

There was barely enough space in the control room for four people. They were all breathing each other's air. Their breath condensed on the cold glass faces of the dials and gauges. Hemi took a rag from a hook and reached in front of the two seated men to fastidiously wipe each of the little round windows clean. 

"One hundred meters," said Gregory.

"OK. Level us off," said Hemi. Gregory and Bastian spun closed some of the trim tank valves and rolled the dive planes back to align with the long access of the sub. The angle of the boat slowly eased upwards, bringing the deck level beneath their feet. 

Hemi stood staring at the dials in front of Bastian and Gregory, his massive arms crossed in the rough wool of his tight-fitting tweed suit jacket. He tapped the thick fingers of one hand against the leather elbow patches while his other hand stroked his wiry black beard. He gave a few more instructions and got the boat moving slowly and silently, running level at depth. The idea was to sneak quietly away --- the most routine tactic of all submarines. But the routineness of it did not reduce the sense that they were playing the role of prey. 

Percy pulled a new cigarillo from the crinkled pack in her pocket and lit it. She sucked at it, and then ashed into a tin cup wedged between the pipes running along the wall. 

Being underwater meant they had to run on batteries. The diesel engines the submarine used while on the surface generated power that drove the propellers and charged the batteries. But those engines breathed far more air than humans, and so could not be used underwater. Running on batteries, with just the electric motors driving the props, made the boat nearly silent. The electric motors produced a hum that was audible inside the boat (Percy always thought it to be a pleasant, reassuring hum), but was barely detectable by another vessel. Eventually the batteries would run down though, and they would have to get back up on the surface to recharge the batteries with the diesels.

[//]: # (### They realize there's something wrong)

But Percy's intuition was plaguing her again. "Something isn't right," she said aloud to no one in particular. Like when they had been rammed, the _Prospect_ was again doing something that she had not felt before. But this time it was not a quick jolt. It was something so subtle, such a delicate change in the motion of the boat, that the others did not feel it at all. Actually, she was not even sure it was a change in the _motion_ of the boat. Maybe it was something in the information she was getting from the gauges that was not making sense. 

No single instrument was reporting anything amiss. But then, no single instrument on a submarine described the total status of the boat. All the instruments had to be taken together, internalized, and combined with what the physical movements of the boat that one felt. Percy typically held the depth in her head, while also taking into account the dive plane angle, the speed, and the overall feeling of the boat. Normally, she processed it all automatically, and she could just _know_ what her boat was doing from a quick glance at the wall of dials combined with what her senses told her and dead reckoning from the accelerations she had experienced.

This feeling of internalizing what her boat was doing --- something she did continually, to the point where it felt like the boat was part of her body --- now felt inexplicably broken. 

Her eyes scanned back and forth across the dials, but the information did not come together. There was no way to make sense of the dials. In this steel tube with no windows, perhaps for the first time ever, she felt blind.

"Hemi... what the fuck is going on...?"

"I do not know... we are within normal tolerances... though..." He reached past Gregory and turned the rudder. The boat came along, slowly. "Sluggish?"

[//]: # (### Percy goes looking for what's wrong)

"I need to go look my girl over. Let me know on the PA if something happens." 

Hemi nodded and Percy slipped down the ladder to the deck below. She stepped to the front of the navigation and sonar compartment and climbed down a steel ladder to the middle deck of the boat. This was crew quarters. The _Prospect_'s third deck-crew member, Owen Smalls, was off watch and snoring in his rack behind one of the moth-eaten old bed curtains. She continued through a hatch at the rear end of crew quarters and down another steel ladder to the lowest of the three main decks. If there were something physically wrong with her boat, this deck was the most likely place to figure out what it was.

She flipped on the lights. There was no red night lighting rigged down here, it was just bare white bulbs behind protective steel cages. The lights stretched off in a line on the ceiling, forward and aft of her. This particular lower-deck compartment was entirely full of batteries, strung together with a web of black cables as thick as her finger. The cables were grouped together with wire ties and slung along the racks in heavy bundles. The batteries were bolted with rusting steel straps to row upon row of steel shelves. 

She got to her knees. The steel grating of the deck pushed through the knees of her leather overalls where they were cracked and worn. She put her fingers through the grating, lifted it up, and put it aside. She reached her hand down and felt the raw steel of the pressure hull. It was cold, damp, and greasy, but that was normal. She replaced the grate and went on to the next compartment forward.

More batteries here, though not as many as the previous compartment. They lined the walls, but not as deeply because there were trim tanks on either side within the pressure hull. She checked below the grating again, but here too everything had the normal amount of greasy dryness. She passed forward through a hatch into the main cargo hold.

The main cargo hold was one giant void occupying most of the front half of the boat. More than thirty meters long, and almost ten meters wide. The air was still and stale. It smelled of rust and petroleum, grease and oils. The overhead bare bulbs had a harsh jaundiced yellow color. The hold was mostly empty --- they had been coming from their last cargo drop-off and were heading toward the depots in the north in hopes of getting another shipping run job. A few wooden crates, stippled green and black with mold, were stacked along the sides. In another nook were stashed a couple of welding rigs wrapped with chain and some bins of scrap metal piled up against a greasy grill used for cooking on deck. It had always bothered Percy that they could not find a more considered place to stash these sundries than the cargo hold.

She walked along the centerline of the space, the spine of the boat, listening carefully. It seemed to her that there was something wrong with the sound of her footsteps on the metal grating. As she neared the front of the compartment, she realized it was not the sound of her footsteps that was off, it was that she could hear water trickling faintly. She knelt and pulled up the grating. There was a pond of oily black water just under the deck level. In it swam a small school of old cigarette butts. Little ripples formed from resonance with the hum of the electric motors, their vibrations passing up the hull and encoding themselves on the scum of the surface here. 

There should not be this much water. Now Percy knew exactly what was wrong with her boat: the ramming had cracked the pressure hull, and the _Prospect_'s cargo hold was filling slowly with water.

[//]: # (### Hemi deals with the pursuing sub in the control room)

"Keep this depth, and course, I will be down at sonar listening for that sub." Hemi climbed down from the cramped control room to the compartment below. If he turned and leaned back from the sonar station, he could almost see up into the control room just behind and above him, and could still instruct the men at the controls of the boat. Likewise, Gregory and Bastian could still give him reports on the _Prospect_'s status, albeit with a little more emphasis thrown into their voices so they carried below to Hemi. 

Hemi did not bother sitting down at the sonar station. Instead, he stood behind the empty sonar operator's chair and slipped the headphones with the worn ear-pads onto his head, covering one ear. He spun the control wheel for the sonar slowly, listening for human sounds out in the malevolent underwater darkness. There was nothing but silence.

"Hemi," Gregory called down through the hatch, "I'm having trouble keeping the boat level. I find I keep having to give it more and more upward dive plane angle just to keep from gaining depth."

"Let me come up and play with the trim tanks." Hemi climbed the ladder back to the control room. He stood at the trim tank controls next to Gregory and the thick pads of his fingers spun one small steel valve-control wheel, then the next. Each was accompanied by the sound of water pushing through pipes, flowing from one end of the boat to the other. "How's that?" asked Hemi after a few minutes of adjustments.

"Better, but still quite a bit more dive plane angle than I would expect just to keep the boat level," said Gregory.

Hemi did not say what he was thinking: that they were sinking.

[//]: # (### Percy goes to recruit Chips to help fix the leak)

"Sweet fucking hell," Percy said to herself. "Sweet fucking hell!" she repeated at a yell. She ran up the length of the cargo hold, her clomping boot steps echoing in the empty space. Back in the battery compartments, she pulled the heavy watertight bulkhead closed behind her with a loud metal-on-metal sound and turned the wheel to seal the cargo hold. It took all her strength; the screw-wheel seals in this part of the sub were rarely used, and they were planting themselves ever more firmly into a rusted stasis with the passing of time.

She climbed up a deck and crossed from the back of crew quarters, through the galley, and into the engine room. The only sounds there were the throb of the electric motors spinning in the next compartment, and a randomized clanking of tools from the deck below. She leaned over the open hatch to the lower engine room.

"Chips! Chips, come over here."

The clanking sound stopped and the face of the _Prospect_'s engineer appeared below the opening a moment later, peering up at her. Chips's hands were black with grease that had also created a grimy patch on the leather apron she wore. In her hands, as if she had been butchering some small game animal for dinner, she held the shell of a deconstructed piece of machinery about the size of a baseball.

Chips's real name was Irene something-or-other, but Hemi had stuck her with the nickname "Chips" when she had signed on. According to Hemi, "Chips" was the traditional nickname for a ship's carpenter, going back to antiquity. And even though there was little carpentry to be done on a submarine, the ship's carpenter was generally responsible for any number of random jobs that were not already assigned to the deck crew. When she had first come aboard, Hemi had such a list of things that needed doing on the _Prospect_ that he felt the name was appropriate to the new position. Also, he had always wanted a "Chips" on the boat --- he was a fan of the classics.

"What the fuck is going on Percy?" Chips asked.

"There's a leak." These were words no submariner ever wanted to hear. But Chips had fixed leaks before. It would be the answer to Chips's next question that Percy was loath to give her.

"I was wondering when one of you assholes would make their way down here and tell me that the fuck's with all the fucked motions of the boat. Where are we leaking?"

"...In the cargo hold."

"And it's fuckin' bad, eh?"

"Ah, pretty... fucking bad. An Authority sub rammed us on the surface, apparently split open the pressure hull."

"Split it... in the fucking cargo hold, you said? So then we're fuckin' fucked, eh? Haven't I always fucking said that cargo hold's too fucking big, and it should have bulkheads? The fucking boat won't float if it's flooded, eh, Capt' Percy? That's what you're fuckin' thinking right now, ain't it? You probably didn't want to even fucking tell me because you know that we're fuckin' fucked!" She threw her piece of machinery at the wall, where the loose assembly separated and sent small parts flying far into the black corners of the lower engine room.

"For fuck's sake Chips, yes, we're fucked, but we're not _fuckin'_ fucked, not yet... I need you to take one of the guys, go in there, and see if you can stop it and patch it so we don't get to the point where we _are_ fuckin' fucked. Right?"

"Ah, fuck ya, Capt'." Chips started climbing up the ladder towards Percy without looking at her.

"Your fucking attitude! Listen to me," Percy held her arm. "Good or bad, I need regular reports. Get Owen up and get him helping you."

Chips wrenched her arm free. "A-fuckin'-OK." She gave Percy a mock salute and pushed past toward the upper engine room.

Percy left Chips digging out hull patch kits from engineering storage compartments and returned to the control room.

Gregory's square head came around and his beady eyes caught hers as her head popped up through the hatch in the floor of the control room. "Wish we had something to shoot at those fuckers who rammed us."

"Someday, you handsome young man, I'll refit the _Prospect_ as the first merchant sub with a torpedo tube --- just for you. Until then, our defense is the same as any prey animal's: run and hide."

"If you are back in the control room for the moment," said Hemi, "I will go down to sonar to work on tracking that sub with the ram's location. And how is our boat? Holding up?"

"We're sinking. I put Chips on it." 

"If she can patch the boat with expletives and downright pissed-offedness, we will be in good hands," said Bastian, without turning around.

[//]: # (### Percy looks at the situation in the conn)

Percy stepped off the control room ladder and yielded it to Hemi on his way down. She addressed Gregory and Bastian, sitting in front of her in their control chairs. "What's the state of my ship boys?"

"Apparently we're fucking sinking," Gregory answered. 

"Fucking apparently..." she agreed. She scanned the gauges. There was nothing immediate to announce their impending doom. It was written instead in subtle ways, spread across the dials, and only when the readings of the dials were taken together. The dive plane angle was too steep for the amount of forward drive they were giving the boat. The trim tanks too light. The depth deeper than she wanted.

"Since that sub is going to know where we are anyway, you might as well crank the bilge pumps up to maximum power. Making a bunch of noise is better than sinking."

Gregory flipped some switches and another frequency of vibration was added to the regular background hum from the motors. 

Percy lit a cigarillo from the rapidly depleting pack in her pocket and smoked it down, letting her mind sink into the ever-present hum of the machines that swamped her environment, ruminating on the gauges. "How's she handling, generally?"

"The boat just doesn't seem fucking normal, Cap. It doesn't respond how I want it to," said Bastian.

"Here, let me try the rudder." She reached over him and turned the wheel hard over. The _Prospect_ came about slowly but surely, leaning over slightly, as she should. But after a short delay the whole boat took on a sudden heavy list. Percy counter-steered and brought the _Prospect_ back to the course they had been on.

"See? That doesn't seem quite fuckin' OK to me," said Bastian.

Percy knew it was worse than that. The sharp list after the delay was the weight of the slack water in the bilge pouring over to one side and dragging the rest of the boat over with the weight of its movement.

[//]: # (### Percy goes to check on Chips' progress)

A short while later, Percy had finished her cigarillo. "I... need to go check on Chips." She slid down the ladder from the control room, passed Hemi, listening to the headphones at the sonar station, and continued forward until she got to the steep metal stairs down into the cargo hold. 

Chips and Owen were working at the far end where, they had rigged bright work lamps. Owen was dragging one end of a fat, gray, grimy hose for an old mobile bilge pump from the pool of black water in the bow up the middle of the cargo hold toward the fixture set in the wall where a hose could be fed to the trim tanks. Chips had pulled out and stacked a whole set of the deck grates to expose the pond of scummy black water underneath. She was wearing thick rubber waders and standing directly on the inside of the pressure hull, in the fetid water which had risen above the grating level almost to Chips' chest --- a distressing sight, tempered in Percy's mind only by the knowledge that Chips was not a tall woman. Chips wore heavy rubber welding gloves and a swim mask so she could see what she was doing under the water. Above the swim mask she wore another dark-lensed welding mask that could flip up or down as the work required. 

As Percy walked down the cargo hold, Chips' head disappeared under the surface. Percy stood on the grating above, watching. The welding rig next to her revved up with a hiss and a groan, and a stream of bubbles and flashing blue light pierced through the turbid water. When Chips lifted her head for air, water ran down her mask in rivulets and drained in a greasy gray stream from her matted hair. Percy asked for her report.

"Fuck you, ya dominating fuckin' cow. This is delicate fuckin' work here and you're up on there in the control room sloshing the whole fuckin' boat back and forth. And it needs fucking time. The hull's got hundreds of tiny cracks. It's split open the way ya might break off a piece of cheese --- tiny cracks all the fuckin' way along. If it were one big crack it would be much fucking simpler. Hand me that fuckin' patch piece by your feet."

Percy spat, and her spit tasted oily and gritty. She handed Chips the flat piece of sheet steel, which was coated with a slippery residue. Chips held it against the side of the hull and pulled a hammer from a loop on her waders. She hammered it against the side of the hull with heavy, ringing smacks, shaping it to the interior curve of the boat. Percy was sure she could hear the ring of the hammer traveling along the steel pressure hull all the way to the stern. She could imagine the sound going out into the water, which felt like a violation of her basic instinct to always keep her submarine quiet. It hardly mattered, though, since those their pursuers would already know their location anyway. 

Chips took her now appropriately curved piece of patch steel and submerged herself in the filth again. 

Percy watched her work for a quarter of an hour or so. Even in that short time she could see that the line of water on the hull had risen, crawling its way up the grated deck. Owen came back and started up the rattly old bilge pump, and with a whine and a rush of water that gave a serpentine life to its hose, it began a losing battle to reclaim some of the deck from the maw of the beast that was slowly consuming the boat.

It was hopeless though. The water level in the cargo hold was rising more slowly now that Chips had some patches in place, but it still rose, relentlessly. By the time Chips next brought her head above water, Percy had made a decision she did not want to make. "Keep working," she told Chips. "I'm going to blow the tanks and bring us up to the surface."

"Fuckin' smartest thing ya said yet this fuckin' day. This course we're pursuin' right now is on a fuckin' trackway to the gates of fucking Hell."

[//]: # (### Hemi blows the tanks)

Percy climbed back up the stairs to the third deck, moving towards the control room. As she passed Hemi at the sonar station, she told him she wanted to blow the tanks. He nodded, as if he had been expecting this. "What about the sub following us?" he asked.

"We've reached the point where we're better off with them up there than fucking sinking down here," she replied. "I'll be in the control room to keep her stable during the rise. I want you to open the tank blow valves."

"OK," said Hemi, taking off the headset as he stood up from the sonar station.

Blowing the tanks was an emergency maneuver. It meant opening the valves that would allow air to flow through the convoluted paths of the old pipes of the ship and push into the tops of the main ballast tanks. The air forced into the top of the tanks would push water out the bottom. When enough water was forced out, the huge bubbles of damp, greasy air held at the submarine's sides would rapidly raise the boat up to the surface, like a child being gripped by the armpits and tossed upwards. Fully blowing out the tanks was only ever done in emergencies and drills, and drills were few and far between on a cargo sub like the _Prospect_. It put stresses on the old boat, stresses it had been designed to handle --- when it was built more than twenty years before.

The emergency blow station was at the back of the sonar and navigation compartment, where the equipment made a subtle shift from the electrical to the mechanical. It consisted of more than a dozen stacked pipes mounted against the wall of the compartment. The pipes ran forward and aft from the blow station, off into the many deep, complicated parts of the ship that controlled buoyancy. Each pipe was about the diameter of a large soup can. They had been repainted many times, giving them a thick smoothed-over texture, except where the paint had chipped off with flecks of rust. Some passed through on their way up to the tank control panel in the control room. Others routed through this compartment simply for the convenience of the boat's engineering. 

Four of the thickest pipes led from the high-pressure air tanks to the main ballast tanks. Large valves were set in-line in those pipes that could be opened or closed by turning a heavy hexagonal nut with a large wrench.

Hemi opened a long metal toolbox bolted to the wall between the pipes and took out a wrench as long as a forearm --- not Hemi's forearm, but the forearm of an average-sized human. The wrench was wrapped in a pilled rag that had been dyed a bland gray color from the decades of grease worked permanently into the fibers. He fitted the end of the wrench over one of the heavy nuts controlling the valves and wrapped the rag around the grip end of the wrench.

"I am ready to blow the tanks," he said with some emphasis, aiming this statement toward the control room hatch, forward and above him. "At your service, Sylvia."

There was a pause while Percy worked with Gregory to get the trim tanks and control surfaces of the boat configured the particular way she wanted them for this hazardous maneuver. Then: "OK Hemi, open the ballast blow valves!"

Hemi pushed his fat thumb against the cracked black rubber coating of the emergency blow alarm button set in an electrical box between the pipes. A klaxon wailed into the deepest corners of the _Prospect_. Then he turned the wrench until it was horizontal, aligning it with the run of the pipe. He repeated this action with the sister pipe running just above it, which  would blow the aft ballast tanks. Accompanying each turn was a squeal and a hiss, and then a rush of air moving through the pipe, like the howl of an ancient god's hunting hounds, riding across the sky. 

The expanding air in the pipes forced their temperature to drop. Their surfaces were instantaneously coated in condensate, which froze and sublimated to vapor, rising up and away from the pipes like two long otherworldly fingers passing through the compartment and gripping the ship. From where Hemi stood, the air in the pipes felt like the shot of a cannon moving past him, leaving a trail of smoke marking its path. He had the sense of it pushing into every corner of the ship, like blood pumped into the furthest capillaries of a body. The flushing sound of the water pressed out into the sea passed through the ship, and the very mass of the ship itself shifted under the force of it.

"Take us up guys. Set the dive planes, and blow any trim tanks you haven't yet." Gregory and Bastian turned the control wheels. But within seconds Percy again felt her boat moving distressingly, like a wounded animal. The stern was rising faster than the bow. The deck under her feet was angling in the wrong direction. 

"What is going wrong?" she shouted at Gregory. Her eyes scanned rapidly across the instruments. "Trim!" She started spinning open valves on the tank control panel, trying desperately to get more air into the bow and level the boat. Gregory's arms were bulging with tensed muscles as his hands gripped the dive-plane control wheel, battling to angle the bow upwards.  

A hazard light lit on the tank status panel accompanied by a foul buzzer. "Hemi!" Percy shouted down through the hatch. "The forward tanks didn't blow!"

"The valve is wide open, Sylvia," Hemi said, looking at the indicator etched on the nut to double-check his work. "The ramming must have pinched shut the high-pressure pipes to the forward ballast tanks."

The stern slowed its ascent. The _Prospect_ hung in the water, the bow pitched downwards. "We're no longer rising," said Bastian, looking at the depth gauge.

Hemi stepped under the hatch up to the control room and looked up at Percy through the small circles of his glasses. Given his height, his face was only a few finger-widths from the hatch opening. "Sylvia," he said, "I think we need to start thinking about more drastic measures to get us back on the surface."

[//]: # (### Percy blows the fuel ballast)

"The fuel oil ballast?" Percy asked Hemi. Though he could mean nothing else.

"Yes, I think we should dump the diesel. Even if we get to the surface, we could lose the boat if the cargo hold keeps flooding and we cannot figure out how to empty it. That is a bigger risk than not having enough fuel oil to get to a port --- if we do manage to keep the boat on the surface."

Percy considered. But sometimes considerations are meaningless. They had passed the point of developing a strategy to evade their pursuers. The situation she now faced was reduced to a single aim: to get to the surface at any cost. Knowing that, the decision to blow out the fuel ballast tanks --- to dump all their diesel fuel in the ocean --- was one she without so much as a pause for consideration.

"OK, Hemi. Come up here. Keep her under control. I'll blow the fuel ballast myself."

There were in fact two long, thin toolboxes bolted to the wall at the emergency blow station. One, with the main ballast tank blow wrench, Hemi had already used. The second toolbox was padlocked. It contained the fuel ballast blow wrench. Just like the main ballast, the fuel oil tanks could also be blown out with high pressure air, the difference being that blowing the fuel out of the boat might give them an emergency pocket of air to lift them to the surface, but it would leave the boat with no fuel --- stranded and unable to maneuver.

 To ensure the fuel oil tanks could never be blown accidentally, Percy was the only person who carried the key to this second toolbox. She unlocked the toolbox and withdrew another wrapped wrench, the same length as the tank blow wrench. But this one had a special five-sided socket that would only fit the nut to open the air line into the fuel ballast tanks --- the fuel ballast could not be blown out with a normal hexagonal wrench. 

She pushed the emergency blow alarm button again, and with the klaxon whining, she fit the wrench onto one of the special nuts controlling the valve in the air pipe. Percy was pretty sure these valves had never been turned before, not even in a drill. They had been painted over many times during the _Prospect_ decades of operation. She put all her weight onto the end of the lever and let out a long groan but could not budge it. She reached for a spare length of pipe that lay all but forgotten on top of one of the high-pressure pipes against the wall and slipped it over the handle of the wrench to extend the length and get some more leverage.

The nut slowly turned as she bore down all her weight on the end of the extended lever. One-quarter turn to the stop at the open position.

Another rush of high-pressure air pushed its tendrils through the ship. Their precious fuel oil --- the only way to escape the lost emptiness of the ocean and return to port --- was thrown away from them, out into the dark waters under the ocean. She repeated the process for the nut that controlled the compressed air into the aft fuel ballast tanks.

Percy could feel the _Prospect_ respond immediately. The angled deck under her feet leveled off, and the bow came up. She climbed to the control room, cramped again with its full complement of three people and one giant.

"Now... now are we rising?" Percy asked after a few minutes. But she was looking at the same gauges as everyone else. She could read them as well as anyone else.

"We're... holding," Gregory reported tentatively.

Hemi made a few adjustments on the tank trim control panel, and managed to get the _Prospect_ level in the water, but could not get the depth gauge to move. They sat more than ninety meters down from the surface.

Hemi gave his pragmatic analysis: "The fuel ballast tanks are just not big enough to overcome half our forward main ballast being flooded."

Percy scanned her eyes back and forth over the gauges, dials, and the settings of the switches, looking for something, anything, that could move her boat upward. She pulled a rag from a hook on the wall and reached over Bastian to wipe at the dials. Then she smashed the meaty part of her hand against the wall next to the primary depth gauge. "Rise, you bitch!"

"Even if we escape from this pit down here, there's hunters waiting for us up there," Gregory said quietly. 

"They would have heard our emergency blow. They can see we are not surfacing. With any luck, they will believe we are sinking," said Hemi.

"We _are_ sinking, aren't we?" said Bastian. "Small fucking comfort that they know it too."

Owen, the youngest of the crew, stuck his head up through the hatch. "Captain Percy, Chips wants me to tell you that all the movement of the boat has split the cracks in the hull wider. The flooding in the cargo hold is getting worse. No, wait, she said to tell you this part exactly: 'The fucking cargo hold of your shitty tub is flooding like a damned bitch in her first season of heat' ...was what she said."

"Her words exactly, huh?"

"Under the dark part of the pit are the poison spikes," said Gregory.

Owen looked at Gregory with a specific question on his face, but asked a different one. "Can't we surface, Captain?"

"Go back and help Chips. Do anything she asks of you. Get the cargo hold patched and the flooding stopped."

"Alrighty." Owen's head disappeared back down below.

[//]: # (### Percy decides to head for the bottom)

Percy was running out of ideas. It was easy to make the decision to get to the surface at any cost while there still remained some levers to pull and options to choose between. But now there was nothing she could think of that could move them upward. 

She cleared her mind. The surface was less than a hundred meters away --- there were people who could throw a ball that distance. The surface was not her natural environment anyway. Up there was war, borderlines, treaties, enforcers, and Authorities. Up there was conflict, nations, and bureaucracy. Under the dark water was where she belonged. Where she could steer her boat in whatever direction she chose, free to go where she liked, when she liked. This was a virtue of being able to move along the Z axis --- something only available to submarines. It provided an exponentially larger amount of room to maneuver. Still, she had no desire to die down here. And no matter how safe and free she felt underwater, there was always that yawning gulf underneath. A dark, cold, bottomless chasm. Once you go _too_ far under, you go under forever. She enjoyed her freedom, but she did not want to wallow in its icy depths.

She put the idea of the surface aside. What if she did look under the dark water instead of up toward the surface light? What was down there in the abyss? What if they could find safety in the deep?

"Hemi, how far down is the bottom where we are now?"

"One thousand meters, give or take. Essentially bottomless."

"Hmm." She slipped down the ladder from the control room and stepped forward to the navigation table located just behind the sonar operator's station.

The navigation station sat on top of a stack of flat files containing charts that were not of immediate use. Behind the flat files, rolls of more commonly-used charts were stacked between upright stakes. With the white lights on, the charts showed their age, yellowed and flaking at the edges.

Hemi had marked the _Prospect_'s current position on a glass sheet laying over the chart that showed the region of the ocean they were moving through. The black smudges of grease pencil trailed up away from the shoreline they had left days before. They were in the middle of the ocean. It was a wasteland, far from any continental shelf or island that they could make it to on battery power alone, while slowly sinking. 

She pulled down a magnifier that hung from the ceiling by a retractable line. She looked closely at the grease markings on the chart, and the depth markings around them. "Hemi... come down here." 

Hemi's bulk eased down the ladder from the control room. She pointed to a spot on the chart. "Figure out how to get us here --- assuming we can hold the boat over the pit and squeeze every last watt from our batteries."

Hemi peered through the magnifier at the chart, then pulled his slide rule from his pocket. He made some adjustments and marks with the grease pencil on the glass. He touched his fingertips with the point of the pencil while muttering some numbers out loud. "It is too close to call, mathematically. I cannot say if it is possible."

"If we can't do it, it's a fucking long way to the bottom."

"If I spend some time tracking our exact depth, speed, battery status, and most importantly how quickly we are gaining depth, then I can get a sense of our rate of, um...decline. I would then be better able to tell you what our chances are. I need a short span of time to do that."

"I don't want chances Hemi. I just want you to figure out how to make those numbers add up so we can find the bottom with the boat intact, and not a mile under water." She ascended to the control room.

[//]: # (### They make the run for the tablemount )

Percy gave Bastian and Gregory a new heading, and Bastian brought the sub limping around to it by gingerly applying some rudder. 

"You guys have to do everything you can to keep us up," she told the two men at the controls. "Like gliding an airplane with a stalled engine. And I want to creep out of here. If we go too fast those fuckers above will hear us and know we are still moving. If we are slow and silent, they might just assume we disappeared down into the hole. Give us three knots forward speed Bastian."

His long arm moved the throttle controls forward until the speed needle hovered a few hashes above its zero pin, indicating three knots. He withdrew his hands from the controls and attempted to lean his body back in the stiff control seat. He pulled a cigarette from a pack sitting next to the throttle control, put it to his lips, and lit it.

"Hey Gregory, you ever think about what the fuck it must be like when a submarine goes down?"

Gregory glanced at Bastian quickly, but returned his eyes to the controls.

"Seriously," Bastian continued in his droning quiet voice. "Fuck. The worst thing about submarining is if something goes wrong, it usually isn't a fast death. Like, in an airplane, something goes wrong, you're gonna splat against a fucking mountain in a matter of minutes --- that's if you don't get blown to pieces at 30,000 feet in the first place. Or on a surface ship, if the thing capsizes, you'll drown in minutes. But on a sub, you usually know your fate long before it comes for you."

"Shut the fuck up, Bastian."

"It's important to be ready for this stuff Gregory! You gotta steel your mind, desensitize yourself to the possibility. Otherwise, you'll be fucking panicking when the time comes." Bastian put a reassuring hand on Gregory's shoulder and sucked at his cigarette. "But that is the fucking horror of a sub. We watch these dials in front of us all day and night, right? Those gauges have our fate encoded on them. Or at least the fate of the _Prospect_. But at some point --- maybe not so far off --- the fate written on those dials might include our end." Bastian tapped a long finger on the depth gauge. "The dials are where we'll see it first. We will be looking at them, and the arrangement will slip, just a few ticks, probably, on just a few dials, but there it will be --- our damnation. And we'll know, every last one of us, and there will probably be fucking shit-all we can do about it."

"But your stupid fucking point is that it takes a long time on a sub..."

"It takes a long time. From the moment we read it off the dials, it could be _hours_ before we sink below crush depth. If we go down _fast_, it would still take the better part of a hour. And we'll be hearing the last throes of the boat the whole way down --- the groans of the hull, the creaking supports, the collapsing trim tanks... I like to think the final failure, the big one that sends the wall of water through the boat that comes so fast it smashes your skull against some rusty bit of steel and finally ends it for you --- that last failure, I like to think it will be silent. I like the idea that the last thing we will hear is rushing water. Somehow that's a fucking comfort to me."

"You are a motherfucker, Bastian."

"This is _your_ lifestyle too, Gregory. You should accept it instead of being afraid of it. Because having your skull caved in against the hull is the _good_ way to die on a sub. Un-fucking-fortunately, these boats are way stronger than the engineers give them credit for --- sure, the boat might get too deep, we might lose control of it, might sink to the bottom mostly filled with water... But you might also get lucky --- lucky enough to end up in a compartment that holds on to its precious bubble of air. And then you'll sit in that compartment for days, maybe even more than a week, sucking up the last of your breathable oxygen. And there's nothing to do but stare at the dark, waiting to die."

"Damn you, Bastian! Shut the fuck up!"

"Bastian, lay off," said Percy. "No submariner is required to contemplate the worst possible scenarios if they don't fucking want to."

Bastian grinned and sucked at the last of his cigarette before stabbing it out in an overflowing can of butts at his feet.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### staring at dials: depth vs the tablemount)

"OK," Percy said to herself. "The only thing that matters right now: how fast are we sinking?"

Figuring this out required nothing more than reading their fate from the wall of dials and gauges in front of them, with their spindly little black fingers all creeping slowly one way or another, depending on what each was tasked with monitoring. The individual parts the dials had to play all came together in a symphony that marked time toward some unknown end. It could be their doom, as Bastian had been saying, but Percy preferred to leave the end result as an unknown. She just needed to know the _rate_ at which they were headed toward it.

Each gauge represented a variable in the equation that controlled whether they lived or died: speed, battery charge, battery drain rate, the status of the trim tanks, course, rudder, ship angle, dive plane angle... Every metric mattered, but as in every equation, some variables weighed more than others. The two that mattered most to Percy were the depth-of-ship gauge --- which featured in most submarine maneuvers --- and the depth-under-keel, which told them how far below the ocean bottom was. It rarely factored into a submarine maneuver, at least in the deep ocean.

The depth of the boat was slowly, slowly increasing. Percy stared at the black line of the needle on the dial and willed it to stay still. She was pretty sure Gregory and Bastian were doing the same. But it never stopped its shaky wavering, and it persistently made gains towards the deep end of the dial. It had already crept three quarters of the way around --- on a dial that was graduated in such a way that the far end, where its tiny steel bounding needle poked up, was theoretically deeper than the boat could survive. If the needle ever tapped that pin, no one would be alive to see it happen.

They had watched the needle's traverse the way one might track a long journey on a map. It seemed they had traveled interminably far to get where they were now, and they looked back at the three quarters of the dial they had passed the way one remembers days and days on the road in a long cross-country journey. 

The even more critical gauge at the moment was that depth-under-keel gauge. The sonic instrumentation that fed that gauge had a limit to its sensitivity. It could show the depth of the bottom far beyond what the submarine was capable of reaching, but nowhere near the actual depths of the deep ocean. At the far end of that dial, the bounding pin of this gauge was labeled according to ancient sailing tradition: "Bottomless." 

And it did not matter that somewhere down there might be an actual bottom. For this sub, for their pursuing sub, for any submarine that Percy had ever heard about, the deep ocean was in all practical ways a never-ending hole. Anyone who went down there would never find a bottom and could never come back up. They each lived much of their submariner lives floating on delicate bubbles of gas over that dark hole, which never ceased in its efforts to suck them down. The needle of the depth-under-keel dial had been pegged at "Bottomless" for days now as they had been crossing deep ocean.

Hemi came up into the control room with a clipboard and a pencil and leaned over the glowing red dials, raising the tiny lenses of his glasses with his fingers to bring them into sharper focus. He jotted readings off the dials onto his clipboard. 

Percy fished her hand around among the joists that supported the pressure hull wall, and found a rumpled pack of cigarillos. She shook one out and lit it. "Are we going to make it Hemi?"

"It is razor work, Sylvia. Numbers slide past numbers, and a decimal point worth of difference changes our fate. And even if the numbers _do_ work out in our favor, there is no way to say whether --- should your plan succeed initially --- it simply perpetrates the complete failure of the pressure hull and leaves us permanently on the bottom regardless."

Percy sucked slowly on her cigarillo as she parsed Hemi's assessment. "What you are really saying is that even though it looks fucking hopeless, there is still a goddamn chance."

"There is distinctly a chance, Sylvia."

A third gauge now entered as a heavily-weighted variable in Percy's equation: the clock. In the dramatic submarine stories from the wars, everything happened in quick actions: emergency maneuvers, incoming torpedoes, plunging dives, and explosions. Despite having been in a number of dangerous situations in her years working on cargo submarines, Percy could never relate to the tempo of the old war stories. In her experience, most dangerous situations on submarines were like this one: permeated through with slow, grinding terror. 

Percy could not reconcile the clock's glacial movement with the steady driving movement of the other gauges that mattered. The remaining battery gauge appeared to be determined to get into the red zone. Their depth gauge found its way only towards larger numbers. These two gauges had apparently unmoored themselves from the restrictions of time. Meanwhile the depth-under-keel gauge and the distance they had covered --- which Percy almost subconsciously tracked in her head --- remained mired and hardly budged.

For hours, Percy blearily followed the tiny needles as she sucked down one cigarillo lit from the budded remains of the last. No one in the control room could have been convinced that time was moving at all, except for the unassailable fact that the battery-remaining gauge had dipped into the red-hashed warning zone, and the depth gauge had passed their normal operating limit of 215 meters to find its own red-hatched warning zone.

Percy's eyes wandered back and forth from the clock to their depth, to the battery-remaining, to the depth-under-keel gauge. Their depth and battery were squeezing hard up against the time they had remaining. She stared at the depth-under-keel needle and summoned all the superstitious powers of the universe to move the needle up off the "Bottomless" pin.

For a moment she thought she saw the needle writhe, like the flash of a small bait fish seen catching the sun in a shallow pool of water. But under more sharply focused eyes, the needle remained sitting comfortably on the "Bottomless" pin.

She stood and took a rag from a hook and reached over Gregory to wipe the condensing droplets of water off the glass of the gauge, then circled around the aging pitted chrome casing for good measure. She could feel the little spots of rust and degrading metal catching against the fibers of the rag. She tapped the glass with her finger.

[//]: # (### They land on the tablemount)

And the needle moved. It just wavered, hovered for a second, and then returned to resting wearily on the pin. But she had definitely seen space between the needle and the pin. Her eyes went back to the clock, more minutes passed. To their speed: steady at three knots. To their battery charge: painfully low. To their depth: too deep for comfort.

But the depth-under-keel needle moved again, rising up and falling back, like a dying crone trying to raise herself for one last curse at the world. And then it was wavering unsteadily above the pin. The gap between the needle and the pin was tenuous, but real. 

"Captain," said Bastian, his eyes on the depth-under-keel gauge, "the bottom seems to be coming up."

Percy reached above her head for a strap. "Drive boys, drive." The sea floor was moving towards them, but was still far, far below. So far below that if the boat went down now, the _Prospect_ would be crushed into nothing but a greasy stain on that bottom. But at least now it was a measurable distance instead of the unknowable nothingness of the hole.

Minutes later the depth-under-keel gauge started rising steadily, as if with intention. It gave the impression that they were moving quickly, though in fact their forward speed remained the same steady crawl, while the slope of the bottom had drastically increased. It was rising under them --- a sheer undersea mountain wall. The needle accelerated to show a shockingly quick lift in the sea floor, threatening the possibility that they were about to smack into a mountainside --- from where they would slide helplessly down into the dark pit. Instead, the depth gauge needle rolled hard to the left and then rose back to show they were about ten meters from the bottom. It remained hovering at that level.

"OK, Gregory, now the stupid part: give me a gentle dive plane down angle," Percy said quietly.

"You want to go _down_?"

"Down, Gregory. Right now. Take us to the sea floor."

The dive plane wheel, the steel shiny from the grip of many hands over the years, slipped through Gregory's thick fingers. The bow of the boat eased downwards. Percy pressed the collision alarm button and a klaxon blared through the ship. She pulled the boat PA mic down from the array of radio mics whose cords swayed just above her head and pressed the talk button. "Chips: leave the leak. You and Owen get out of the cargo hold. Seal the bulkheads behind you. We're going to bottom the boat, and there's a reasonable chance it will split our wounded hull there wide open."

At the sound of the collision alarm Hemi came up through the hatch. His eyes passed over the gauges, taking in their situation. "Gently, Gregory," he almost whispered.

"Yes, gently," added Percy, "as gentle as you've ever been, like you're laying down a fevered child. Bastian, disengage the motor. Let's use only what's left of our forward momentum, and let our leaking boat take us down in whatever way she wants to."

Slowly, slowly, the depth gauge needle rotated to the right as the boat sank. And equally slowly, the depth-under-keel gauge turned to the left as the bottom rose. The depth gauge showed 248 meters. The depth-under-keel gauge came to rest on its other limit pin, labeled '0'. An alarm sounded, but only for a brief chirp because Hemi had been expecting it and had been holding his finger on the button to silence it. The whole of the _Prospect_ trembled as the bow touched the bottom. Percy felt the slight angle under her feet relax as the stern came down slowly to rest on the bottom as well.

"Fuck me," said Bastian. "Two hundred and forty-eight meters down, on the bottom. An undersea mountain. And we've landed on the top, like some damned version of Noah crashing his ark into fucking Ararat."

"Technically a tablemount," said Hemi. "A relatively flat surface worn down from an ancient volcano. And yes, if you like, very much an antediluvian feature of the sea floor."

"Quite a bit deeper than she's rated for," added Percy, "almost as deep as I've ever had her. If the hull holds, we have bought ourselves a little time." 

"Seems just as likely that the cargo hold is now completely split open and we will die here," said Bastian. 

Gregory glanced at Bastian with a dark look in his eyes.

"...Regardless of the amount of time we need to spend here, being bottomed has the added bonus of rendering us nearly undetectable to active sonar. If the sub that rammed us is still searching for us, we will blend in with the bottom. They will likely assume we sank," observed Hemi.

"We _did_ fucking sink, Boss," said Bastian. "And I would not be the one to correct their potential thought that they will never see us rise to the surface again."

It was time for Percy to survey the damage. She got on the ship PA and told Chips to meet her at the entrance to the cargo hold.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)

[//]: # (### Repairs on the bottom)

She found Chips waiting for her at the cargo hold bulkhead in the forward battery room on the bottom deck of the boat. Chips had a large wrench with her and as soon as Percy arrived she banged with it on the bulkhead. "Well Capt, it sounds fuckin' hollow to me. Still air on the other side of the fuckin' bulkhead at least."

Percy cranked open the hatch, the rusted sealing wheel squeaking painfully in her ears. The lights were out in the cargo hold, so they were looking into blackness. But the air smelled damp and they could hear many drips echoing in the huge empty space.

Percy reached around and flipped on the lights. The white overheads glared. The steel grating of the floor led down a gentle slope and disappeared into an oily, black subterranean lake. A couple of empty wooden crates floated like lost Viking craft, accompanied by a film of black frothing grease that wafted by in patches like bergs among the Viking ships. Any sound Percy and Chips made echoed back and forth from hull to hull over the water. 

"That's the fuckin' raw material of nightmares," said Chips.

"We probably did more damage to her when we pressed her bow into the sea floor --- like levering apart the bones of a carcass. We don't have much time before this whole hold is flooded --- in which case we'll never get off the fucking bottom. What do you need, Chips?"

"Ah, just send fuckin' Owen back down. This time it looks like I'll be breathing through a fuckin' hose while I'm stitching the fuckin' gash back together."

"Alright. I'll get Gregory and Bastian looking for more portable bilge pumps. They can run hose down and see if we can't get some of this water into the trim tanks and back out into the ocean where it belongs."

"Fuckin' right."

[//]: # (### Percy goes back upstairs, rouses the boys, gets coffee)

Percy found Gregory and Bastian crawling into their bunks in crew quarters, having been released from control duty by Hemi. Their eyes were slitted and bleary and there was no grace in their attempt to climb into their racks.

"Come on, you can't fucking sleep yet. Get some coffee and then go find some portable bilge pumps. We need to get this boat pumped out, or you'll never wake up from your little naps."

She left them groaning and headed to the galley, thinking coffee sounded like a good idea. There was a metal cup sitting upside down in the drying rack, a blue tin cup with the white flecks. The outside of it had been dipped in rubber for use on submarines. Even when well-washed, the cups always added a piquant taste of metal and oil to the coffee. The one in the dish rack was relatively clean, just retaining the usual semi-permanent brown ring stains. 

The coffee in the pot had been on the warmer for hours. Maybe days. She poured it into her cup and added a couple scoops of sugar. The taste was foul, like what she always imagined "sweet crude" must taste like. Her taste buds rebelled, but the rest of her body knew better, and she felt an immediate wash of relief from the fatigue beginning to plague her.

Their situation was dire, but she was feeling better. If being flooded and bottomed had been the worst thing to happen today, she would have been upset. But somehow their relative safety right now compared to where they had been an hour before --- when they were slowly sinking over a bottomless hole --- made Percy feel surprisingly relaxed. Relaxed enough to enjoy a cup of burnt coffee, at least.

[//]: # (### Percy talks to Hemi about surviving their immediate futures)

Percy found another relatively clean tin cup behind the rails of the dish cabinet and filled it with coffee. She brought it to Hemi at the navigation station.

Hemi took the cup and held it to his lips, blowing the acid smell off the surface. His glasses steamed up. "Does Chips have a handle on the leak?"

"Eh. It's under deep fucking water in the hold now. She's going to have to dive down there to weld it."

"Unpleasant."

"That's one fucking word for it."

"Even if we get it sealed," said Hemi, "even if we can manage to pump out, even if we get to the surface, things do not look good. I looked at the chart, and we are approximately nowhere at the moment. And we have no fuel or battery remaining to speak of."

"Still'd rather be nowhere on the surface than sunk on the bottom of somewhere --- in this case that 'somewhere' being a fucking rarely-charted and never-visited undersea mountain."

"We are in a situation where we need to overcome a whole series of challenges, each in order. I am just trying to get ahead of the problem."

"OK, Hemi, you do the thinking ahead. You let me know if I'm not considering something that impacts our future survivability. Otherwise, I need to focus on surviving our situation right now. And that currently means getting some of this foul black water out of my boat. Right?"

Hemi nodded.

"OK. Back to the cargo hold I go then."

[//]: # (### repairing and pumping out the cargo hold)

In the cargo hold, Bastian and Gregory were laying out the heavy cloth-covered hoses down the center of the space and hooking them up to portable electric bilge pumps the size of small refrigerators. Multiple black hoses and thick electrical cables snaked across the floor grating, making navigating the space treacherous.

Owen had his own electric pump --- a smaller one that pumped air --- down at the edge of the black lake, and he was feeding an air hose to Chips, who was wearing a diving mask connected to the hose. She was kicking to keep her head above water while holding up a welding stick with one hand. The welding stick was connected by its own lines to the welding rig propped next to the pump at the edge of the lake and powered by yet more heavy electrical cables running up the deck of the cargo hold. Chocks kept the wheels of the rig from rolling into the water.

Chips dove down, and there was a quiet moment before a hot blue light lit up the surface of the water from below, wavered for a moment, and then died away. This repeated a few times before Chips' head broke back through the surface. She ripped off the diving mask. "Owen! I need another fuckin' piece of steel plate, and --- fuck it --- another brace too."

"Alright!" called the kid from the shore, where the water lapped at the toes of his boots. Owen was wearing the same greasy-slick rubber waders Chips had had on earlier. He selected some metal bits from a pile of scraps on the grating next to the welding rig and waded into the cloying bilge to hand them to Chips.

Every sound in the cargo hold traversed from one exposed steel inner side of the pressure hull to the other, so everything was heard three times. That was normal, and Percy was used to it. But the mass of water filling one end of the cargo hold changed the sound of the space. It ate at her instinctive sense that her boat was far from healthy. It sounded like a room dominated by an athletic swimming pool. It was a quality of sound that should never be heard on a submarine.

She sipped her coffee and watched Chips dive again with the steel plates in one hand. More blue light from under the water. Percy had the idea to track down a meter stick and prop it in the water, so they could all see when the water started to lower. But then she thought better of it, considering the strong possibility of the water quickly rising over the top of the stick.

Instead, she helped Gregory and Bastian get the bilge hoses connected to the trim tanks and set them cranking. The hoses inflated with the pressure of the water running up the gentle grade from the pumps. She could hear it sloshing into the empty trim tanks, and the sound of it echoed between the hull walls.

[//]: # (### Percy inspects the damage)

The next time Chips came to find a patch piece from the scrap pile, Percy took the diving mask from her and waded into the water to inspect the damage personally. The water was the freezing and never-varying temperature of deep ocean water. It had picked up an unpleasant array of smells: a mix of petrochemicals and solvents, refuse, and old grease --- the stuff that always contaminated a ship's bilge --- but that odor was strengthened to a nausea-inducing level by the sheer volume of water. 

Plunging her head through the opaque boundary of the water's surface, Percy could see the damage was bad. As Chips had said earlier: it was not one big split in the metal, it was a long string of short side-by-side cracks running in a line up a massive convex dent where the hull had been rammed. The thick steel of the hull had been bent to an astonishing degree, deformed without massive failure in a way that only high-tensile steel could be. But even steel could only be pushed so far without splitting.

She put her hand out in front of her mask, holding it over the cracks, and she could feel the onrush of the icy water against her warm flesh. Much welding was still required. Chips' patches were pieces of curved steel that she would weld into place over the cracks. Chips was no expert at underwater welding, the welds were globulous and imprecise. It was starting to look like a mess, but nobody else aboard could do better. 

Back out of the water, she stood shivering and dripping oily droplets that clung together in fatty globs on the floor grating. Percy always thought of herself as pretty tough. But in many ways Chips, with her foul language and bad attitude, was a lot tougher. Chips had never even mentioned the temperature of the water.

With the extra bilge pumps running, Percy let Gregory and Bastian stumble up to their racks for another attempt at getting some sleep. And indeed, they slept through the next six hours or so of work while she, Owen, and Hemi did whatever they could to help Chips get the hull welded back together. Since only one person could weld at a time, Percy, Hemi, and Owen found themselves standing around smoking and drinking coffee more than actually working, so Percy eventually sent Hemi and Owen to their racks, too.

She needed to sleep more than anyone. But she knew she would not be able to. Maybe once they got to the surface, but that seemed far off now --- both physically and temporally. She consumed cigarillo after cup of coffee after cigarillo. When Chips needed something, she was there, but mostly Chips had her own method and did not want help. When Chips disappeared below the surface the cargo hold became totally silent. Percy looked at her watch --- time had fallen to its knees and crawled forward only with desperate and gasping heaves. It took her more than an hour to realize that the water level had receded a bit, leaving a greasy black line on the pressure hull to indicate its high-water mark.

Percy allowed herself some small amount of hope. 

The receding water level was everything. The boat did not need power or the high-pressure air system or a running motor to reach the surface --- all she needed was that water level to recede; physics would take care of everything else. The way it was currently set, the boat _wanted_ to float. It was merely being pinned down by a massive black liquid weight.

She waited for Chips to raise her head above the surface again. "Chips! The water level is dropping!" Percy shouted with one hand cupped to her mouth, pointing at the black line of grit marked on the pressure hull.

"Ah fuckin' sure. With the fuckin' quilt of patches I've laid down it's about fuckin' time."

"I have to go up to the control room --- there's really no way to know when we'll get buoyant again, and someone has to be there if we do."

"Aye!" Chips huffed. She waved a hand at Percy and disappeared back under the dark surface.

[//]: # (### Percy back in the control room; staring at dials again)

As Percy passed through the crew quarters she shook the kid Owen awake again. "I have to go to the control room. Go down and watch Chips and make sure she doesn't fucking die."

Owen did not say anything but resignedly rolled out of his rack to his feet, rubbed his eyes, and stumbled toward the cargo hold.

Percy climbed to the control room and sat at one of the maneuvering stations with the familiar array of dials spread out in front of her. The readings had not changed at all since she last left them, for the obvious reason that the sub had not moved. She took in the reading from each gauge separately, adding it to her holistic picture of the situation her boat was in. But she was not learning anything new.

It suddenly occurred to her that the gauges were the wrong place to look for more input about the status of the boat. She would know the boat was rising before any of the gauges showed it. The water was being drained out so slowly that it was not like the boat would just pop off the bottom. First she would feel the leveling of the slight incline it had taken on as it had settled into the bottom. The boat righting itself would be the first indication it was rising, and she would not need gauges to know that was happening.

She returned to her feet, fished her control-room cigarillo pack from its nook in the wall, and lit up. With nothing important to look at, she started pacing back and forth. How long now? She looked at her watch, but realized immediately that that particular gauge was no longer important either.

She glanced over at the control gauges despite herself. This time, just as she did, she saw the angle-of-the-boat gauge waver slightly back and forth in its little glass tube. Ah! She was wrong. The gauges might know first! Seconds later she did feel it. The deck under her feet changed inclination slightly. She reached up and grabbed a strap, and then the whole boat slowly rolled a couple of degrees towards level, shaking off its lethargic repose. But rising from a dead weight on the bottom of the sea was all she did. The boat hung there, relatively evenly trimmed, but the bulk of its weight remained supported by the bottom.

"The trim tanks!" Percy remembered they had been pumping bilge water into them, but that water was still physically inside the _Prospect_. She looked at the ballast control panel. The gauge for the high-pressure air showed the system was severely depleted after their ballast blows. But there was still some residual pressure in the system, and the trim tanks were quite small compared to the big ballast and fuel tanks. She reached to the valve on the ballast panel that would blow bilge water out of the trim tanks and opened it.

There was the usual loud hiss, Percy counted a beat, and then the stern of the boat jumped off the bottom, followed quickly by the bow. The depth-under-keel gauge snapped up to two meters. She could hear suddenly-wakened crew members cursing loudly up at her from the crew quarters. She grabbed the boat PA mic. "Good morning, motherfuckers! We have positive fucking buoyancy."

[//]: # (### A fight with Chips)

The sensation of moving up instead of down felt oddly terrific --- a relief in the change of environmental accelerations that only someone who has acutely attuned themselves to three-dimensional space would recognize. 

As soon as Percy had blown out the trim tanks, there was no stopping the _Prospect_. It was a slow rise, weighted down by the tons of extra weight in water still sloshing around in the cargo hold --- nothing like the violent rise that an emergency blow would elicit had the boat been functioning normally --- but they were steadily moving upward.

Hemi popped up in the control room and stood watching the gauges, smiling a quiet smile of intellectual and mechanical satisfaction. 

"Hemi, don't just stand there like a giant fucking cow," Percy said to him. "Sit at the controls and make sure nothing stupid happens." 

Hemi lowered himself into the planes control chair, already turning the dive plane wheel to achieve a more controlled angle of rise. 

Percy balanced the trim tanks to keep them as level as possible. "Keep the bow slightly down, Hemi, otherwise all that water still in the cargo hold is going to wash right back to the engine room."

A banging and cursing came up to them from the crew quarters, and a second later Chips climbed into the control room, leaving a small puddle of black water at the base of the ladder and a thin trail of the foul stuff behind her as she stepped up to Percy. She was holding a length of steel bracing pipe in her hand.

"Ya gaping and pustulated fucking asshole! Ya almost killed me! What fucking stupid idea came to your impenetrable head to blow the trim tanks with no warning? I was fuckin' washed half-way down the fucking boat!"

"Back off Chips. I gotta deal with surfacing my boat. We can talk about proper emergency procedures later," Percy replied, trying to keep her voice calm.

"Ya fuck yourself and your fucking proper procedures. I'm talking about my fucking life, you fucking swollen and carbuncled head of a syphilitic cock." Chips raised the pipe and pointed it at Percy.

Percy did not even look at Chips, instead keeping her eyes on the depth gauge, which showed the boat steadily coming shallower. "Put that pipe down, Chips."

Chips snapped. She rushed at Percy, swinging the piece of pipe in a long arc across the control room, just missing Hemi's head but connecting with Percy's stomach. Percy doubled over immediately and fell to the cold metal of the deck.

Hemi was out of his seat a second later and had Chips' forearms taut in his huge fists, like bracing on the cables of a massive suspension bridge.

Percy was not down long. She got up to one knee before she fired Chips. "You're off the boat," she said quietly, between gasping breaths. "We get to a port, you take your gear with you when you get off, and never again befoul my boat with your black fungal attitude."

"Ya? Fuck you, you vegetatively stupid sow. I'll fucking be asleep in my rack while your fucking rusting shithole of a boat sinks around you. I don't fucking care anymore. I'd rather die than save your bulbous fucking ass one more time."

Hemi was steering Chips toward the hatch down out of the control room. He had to let her arms go for her to get down the ladder, though he kept the piece of pipe she had been holding. Hemi and Percy could hear her smashing and cursing her way forward to the crew quarters.

"We all need rest, Sylvia," said Hemi.

"I need it more than anyone, but you don't see me swinging pipes at people."

Hemi nodded quietly. But he knew Chips was right on two counts: blowing the trim tanks without warning was incredibly dangerous. And they would never get to a port without Chips's continuous help to patch the leaking hull.
