## 2. The _Gnat_

[//]: # (### Surfaced)

The _Prospect_ rose slowly. It tilted a little on one axis, then the other, as Percy adjusted the trim of the tanks. But the boat rose straight up, more or less, since they did not have the motors running and it was being lifted by buoyancy alone.

Percy and Hemi watched the depth gauge slowly roll itself backwards, up past their test depth, up into what Percy would normally consider safe operating depth, then periscope depth, and then the sail broke through the surface. Those in the crew quarters could feel the boat bob like a cork to the surface, and they let out a small cheer that echoed to the control room from the depths of the boat. They arrived moments later at the bottom of the ladder to the control room, obviously expecting to go out on deck.

At first, Percy was not even going to think about allowing that. Years of experience had reinforced the routine that the first action on surfacing a sub was to scan around with the periscope, if not the radar. There was always a chance that the only safe move would be to dive right back down. But she fought back this instinct: there was nothing on the surface that could be more dangerous than attempting to dive her damaged boat again. She looked down at her crew --- minus Chips --- and waved them up through the control room.

Owen, with his scrawny youthful energy, led the way. He charged up the ladder, struggled with the tightly closed and somewhat rusted hatch-seal wheel for a moment before squeaking it open, and pushed the hatch up with a pop as the slight variation in pressure equalized.

Daylight poured down through the hatch into the control room below. With it came cool air in motion. It was air that smelled of the open sea instead of the stench of warm human bodies, oil, and diesel exhaust. The crew followed Owen out onto the bridge of the sail.

It was a cool, breezy day. Gray clouds hung low overhead, and there was a mild chop on the water. Owen hopped over the fairing and down the rungs on the side of the sail to the main deck, where he ran up and down, shrieking like a small child. 

After a few minutes of just enjoying the surface air, Percy got back to the situation at hand. "Hemi, you were looking at the charts: who controls this part of the surface these days?" she asked.

"Hmm. Perhaps the Western Federated Provinces? At least, they did the last time I looked at a Territorial Authorities map. But that was more than a year ago."

"Those assholes are bad fucking news, and have no tolerance for surface transports --- even ones that have papers," put in Bastian. "We should not stay here."

"We would be on our way right fucking now...if we had any fuel or power," Percy said. "That lovely sound you hear of gentle waves smacking against our hull is the sound of a ship not moving. We're dead in the water, and we're still a bit fucked, folks."

"Owen!" she called down to the deck, "come back up here. We have to get back to work." As he ran over and climbed back up the side of the sail, she laid out their next steps. "Hemi, get down to the navigation chart and see if there's a hope of any place we could limp to with what little  charge we have left on the battery.

"Bastian, get on the radio and see if you can raise anyone on the Independent Operators frequency. Maybe we'll get extraordinarily lucky and find some help from someone who won't ask too many questions."

"Or try to sink us," Bastian added.

"Ya. If you do raise anyone, for fuck's sake don't talk to them --- don't tell them _anything_. Just come get me and I'll try to gauge their reliability myself."

"Sure, Capt," said Bastian.

"Gregory...I'm starving. Want to see if you can get something going in the galley?"

"Sounds good."

"And put a new pot of coffee on too. The shit in there now has been on that burner so long it looks like bunker fuel."

They climbed back down into the control room but left the hatch open, and for the next few hours a blessed breeze blew through, and occasional tendrils of sea air reached as far into the submarine as the crew quarters.

Inside, Percy joined Hemi at the navigation table.

"The most pressing problem," said Hemi, not even waiting for her to ask, "is that the batteries are nearly entirely depleted. Even running extremely judiciously, we have a range of a few nautical miles at best." He used a compass to draw a dotted line around their position, showing what was within range. It was a completely barren section of the chart in the middle of the ocean. It was nowhere.

"Not even close, huh? Well, that just leaves us with the less-than-ideal option of accepting help from someone."

"Most folks who pass in these neglected waters are not much inclined to help those they do not know."

"We'll just have to hope we don't meet most folks then."

She took a couple of steps back to look up through the hatch into the control room and see how Bastian was doing with his effort to achieve that goal. He had one stick-like arm up in the air, adjusting some dials on the radio mounted in the ceiling of the control room. His other hand held the mic that was attached by a curling cloth-covered wire to the radio. He was giving out mayday requests on a couple of different frequencies known to be monitored by other independent shipping operators like themselves --- both legitimate cargo haulers and smugglers. Those frequencies were also often monitored by Authority vessels that might be engaged in policing shipping and transport traffic through their territorial control areas. 

"Anything, Bastian?"

"Fucking nothing. Nothing good or bad. This is one voided piece of open ocean you surfaced us in."

"Alright. I'll check sonar and radar. Maybe someone's listening who just isn't interested in responding."

She stepped over to the sonar station and lifted the headphones over her ears. Without bothering to sit, she turned the directional control wheel with one hand, slowly, back and forth, scanning for the sound of anything made by humans. A minor benefit of being dead in the water was they were not making any noise themselves. She could hear even the small waves against the hull of the _Prospect_. It was a rare pleasure to have such clean and clear sound on sonar. But for all that silence, there was nothing to hear.

The passive sonar was safer to use than the radar because it did not send out any signal that could be detected. You just listened with what were essentially underwater microphones for the sound any other vessel might be making. It also had the advantage that it could be used while submerged. Radar, on the other hand, could only be used while they were on the surface, and it sent out a big loud radio beacon that could be seen by any other ship with a radar unit --- basically all of them. If there were any ships out there, the signal would bounce back to the _Prospect_ and they would know its location. But any other ship in range could also detect their transmitted radar signal and know the precise location of the _Prospect_. Generally, when Percy used radar, her habit was to dive soon afterwards.

In this case, she thought turning on the radar was worth the risk. But the radar sweep rolled twice around the display, showing a completely empty scope. There was nothing for miles in every direction. She left it scanning, eased herself into the sonar station chair, and tried to get comfortable.

For the next few hours, she chain-smoked and listened to the emptiness of the ocean around them on the passive sonar. It was a mind-numbing task, trying to pick out a signal from the muted hiss and rush that came to her from the choppy surface. She swept the sonar mics in a circle, covering every direction out from the _Prospect_ and back again. Having not found anything, she would then begin again. The continual effort at maintaining her attention on the search butted against the complete lack of any signal to focus on or track. She was beginning to think the best move might be to go check that they had enough food and water supplies to survive weeks of drifting on open ocean.

Except then, way off their rear port side, a soft throbbing came into her headset. She closed her eyes. It was faint and threaded, like the last heartbeats of a leviathan. She opened her eyes and glanced at the radar sweep, but it remained completely clean.

She called Hemi over. "Listen to this and tell me what you think it is."

Hemi had exceptional ears for sonar. He stood next to her and put the headphones on, and his eyes lost focus as he listened. The tips of his thick brown fingers rested on the top of the directional control wheel and eased it back and forth across the contact's heading.

"Very small surface craft, and moving...unusual though --- and not just because it is tiny and in the deep ocean. It seems like it has almost no hull sound. I do not hear any wake running along it."

"Can you calculate a range?"

"It is close. Let me see." He looked at the dials of the sonar unit and scribbled some numbers on a scrap paper. "Two nautical miles, thereabouts maybe? I think you should be able to see it with the periscope."

Percy nodded and climbed up into the control compartment. She raised the periscope up and spun it around to the bearing of the target. She rolled the scope barrel slowly back and forth along the horizon line, where the dark gray of the water press-fit up against the light gray of the sky. With the _Prospect_ on the surface, and the scope up, she could see something like ten nautical miles on a clear day. This was as good as vision ever got on a submarine.

"Even if it were a fucking canoe... at two miles away I should be able to see it." There was nothing but unblemished gray fields in her scope. She double-checked the bearing with Hemi, shouting down to the sonar station below. 

She was pointed in the right direction, there was simply nothing there. 

But she had a hunch. She felt confident about the sonar target. She was sure something _was_ there, despite the fact that underwater sound can sometimes play tricks. The lack of any visual on the surface narrowed down the possibilities of what it could be.

"Hemi," she called down again to the compartment below, "I want to motor over closer to it. Keep tracking it on sonar."

Percy put Bastian back in the rudder-throttle control seat. She gave him a heading toward the sonar target and they put one of the electric motors in gear. Her eyes locked on the battery gauge, which waved slightly as the motor started turning, drawing the last amperage from the depleted battery banks. The needles on the battery gauges were deep in the red now. There was such a little gap of air between them and the zero mark. They would only get one shot at this.

They crept --- two nautical miles an hour. After a quarter-hour or so, Hemi called up from sonar. "We got lucky, Sylvia. I am tracking something like an intercept course --- the object is headed towards us at any rate. At our current speed there is no way we would ever have overtaken it if they were heading away from us. It is moving fairly quickly. But..." There was a gap, and Percy could hear him scratching a pencil on paper. "But...we need to go slightly faster. Can you do four knots?"

Percy sighed. It did not sound like much, but it was twice as much power consumption. "You heard the man, Bastian, give her a little fuckin' gas."

There was a burning cigarette between Bastian's bony fingers as they wrapped around the throttle stick and eased it slightly forward.

A few minutes later, Hemi called up, "Good. We will be within a quarter mile of the object in a matter of minutes."

"They must be able to fucking see us. They haven't changed direction or speed?"

"No. Maybe nobody is looking, or they just do not care."

Percy stayed on the periscope, slowly tracking across the bearing. Still nothing.

"Sylvia!" called up Hemi. "They are gone. No detectable signal on the sonar."

"Stop the boat Bastian." The electric motors were very quiet when running this slow, but she wanted Hemi to have total silence for listening. "What was the last range, Hemi?"

"About five hundred meters. They are close. I have to assume they are just sitting idle out there. We could ping them?"

"Ah, that would scare the fucking shit out of them. They might think we were armed and about to fire. We're trying to make friends here. ...I'm going to try ship-to-ship radio. We're just close enough they might hear us, and the radio could be a little less threatening."

Percy reached over her head and flipped on the ship-to-ship radio. A device that was not actually a radio, it just acted like one. It used the sonar rig to push sound through the water to talk to other ships nearby. Five hundred meters was just about the limit of its range. Real radio transmissions were supposed to follow a set of protocols and rules, potentially enforced by agents of Authorities in their respective territories. Ship-to-ship had no rules other than an informal argot that had developed partially to obfuscate meaning for any other ship that might be listening, and had partially evolved from nautical cultural habit.

[//]: # (Is the ship-to-ship radio actually a 1970s trucker CB? You fucking know it.)

Percy took down the mic from the radio and brought it to her lips. She pushed the transmit button, and the needles on the radio unit's gauges jumped to show how much power she was transmitting with. She whistled a series of five randomish tones into the mic, and let go of the transmit button. The power needles died back to zero, and there was silence for a minute or two. 

Then she repeated the transmission of the tones. Another minute passed.

Then a crackly male voice came over the radio, "I see you over there, you hulking ugly gray fuckin' submarine. And I guess you know I'm here. Why are ya sittin' on the surface, and what do ya want with me?"

Percy hesitated, and then transmitted back, "Well, first let me state flat out that we're nothing but a cargo sub --- and let me emphasize: un-fucking-armed. Second, we've been severely damaged, and swam through an icy hell to get back to the surface. We're out of fuel and extremely low on power. Long and short is that we're in some desperate need of help, and you are the only contact we've seen in these fucking desolate waters."

Another moment passed. "Yeah. Well. These waters are empty because the Authorities running this territory right now are a bunch of tight-sphinctered class-A-holes who seem more interested in shooting down transports than letting any commerce commence. It's a fucking bad place to be not moving and on the surface."

"Not moving is hardly typical for us. What are you sitting on there? We don't see any ship in the scope. Any assistance you can offer would be much appreciated."

"Ehh, I'm not one who is much for offering assistance, so for the next few minutes here I think I'm not going to show ya what I'm riding. But if yer telling the truth, I don't envy your dire-ass situation."

"I absolutely understand your unwillingness to not tip your hand. Anything I can do to reassure you we aren't anything other than what we say we are?"

"The territorial Authority motherfuckers around here generally just shoot first, check papers later. They're not much for mind games. So the fact that you haven't already shot at me says a lot." 

There was a long pause of radio silence. Percy held the mic off-angle in her hand while listening. She began to worry that she had lost their only chance for help.

The ship-to-ship crackled back to life. "Alright. I think I can risk pulling alongside ya, and poppin' the hatch. Don't send nobody onto my boat without my say-so, or I'll dive straight out from under ya. Fucking' got it?"

"We'll look for you --- for something --- off the port side. Out."

[//]: # (### Shakes pulls alongside)

"Hemi," Percy called down to sonar, "we've got ourselves something, though I'm hardly sure what. You and Bastian come up on deck with me."

Bastian unfolded his long skinny legs from a cramped-looking position where his feet were propped up on the control panel. He climbed up through the hatch and via the ladder to the bridge of the sail with Percy and Hemi following. The wind was blowing a little harder and the chop had kicked up. Bastian cupped his hands and lit another cigarette. Percy and Hemi shaded their eyes, scanning the water. It was a few minutes before they saw a small gray oblong object cutting through the choppy little waves. It was a tiny submarine sail, no more than a meter long and high, with a couple of thin wispy antennas trailing from the top in the wind. Unusual for a submarine, it had a small viewport in the front of the sail through which the pilot could look. At the rear of the sail a stream of diesel smoke floated up and away behind it. The deck of the tiny sub was totally awash, running just under the surface of the water.

As it got closer, they could see the big splotchy patches of rust all along the hull of the mini-sub, and a slight oil slick of a trail that it left behind in its minimal wake. Bastian, Hemi, and Percy climbed over the fairing of the _Prospect_'s sail and down to the deck. Standing here, Percy was somewhat sickened to see the angle of the deck and the bow of her boat sitting much lower than usual, still weighed down by the tons of excess ballast water.

A moment passed before a hatch opened at the top of the mini-sub's sail, and the head of a man with yellow spiked hair emerged. His arms were still inside the sail, working controls, and he was standing propped on something inside so he could get his head and shoulders high enough above the fairing to see as he guided his craft alongside the _Prospect_. 

Bastian opened the hatch to a wet-storage locker on the deck and pulled out some large white rubber fenders that were flat and deflated after being subjected to the underwater pressure. He connected each to a short hose that led to a fixture for the low-pressure compressed air system inside the wet-storage locker, and let a little puff of air into the fenders until they had been restored to more or less their normal shape. Each fender had a long line that he tied off to recessed deck cleats and lowered down between the two subs.

"Toss a line!" the man in the mini-sub yelled as he let the engine run on idle and stepped over the fairing. He was wearing tall rubber boots as he ran up the washed deck of the small sub. The boots were pulled over leather pants that were originally probably black, but were now cracked and gray at the seams. From the left side of his broken leather belt hung a adjustable wrenches of various sizes, the finish on them beaten away, matte and rusting in places, from years of banging against each other like chimes. He wore a faded black denim vest from which the sleeves had been inexpertly removed, leaving stray threads of denim trailing behind him in the breeze and exposing a pair of sinewy arms.

Bastian, still with a cigarette between his lips, threw across a line. The sub pilot made it fast to a cleat welded onto the hull of the mini-sub, and then repeated the move at the stern. He nimbly leaped across to the handholds on the side of the _Prospect_ and climbed up the curving side to the deck.

[//]: # (### Intro Shakes)

He looked around with a nervous twitch, and then motioned to Bastian for a cigarette, who cupped his hand and lit one off his own before handing it to him.

The man took the cigarette between his fingers and brought it to his lips to suck long and hard. "Ah fuck, thanks. I ran out a couple of days ago. I go by Shakes." He held up his hand level in front of them and they could see it tremble slightly in the air. "Ya can see why." Shakes looked at Hemi, standing just ahead of Percy with his black beard wafting in the breeze. "You the captain?"

Hemi nodded toward Percy. She stuck out a grimy hand. "Captain Percy. Hemi here is my submersible giant and Deck Boss. The skinny one is Bastian."

"That the whole complement?"

"Few more below." Percy was still staring at the mini-sub. "That's a hell of a fucked-up craft ya got there."

"Like it? I built it my self. Welded it together on the top of a fuckin' mountain coffee farm from rotting scraps of metal. They had a bunch of land higher up where the coffee don't grow, and it seemed like a good place to build a boat. It was. 'Cept it wasn't a good place to launch a boat from. Getting it down to the water was way more difficult than the buildin' of it."

"I could imagine," said Hemi.

"I've heard of this kind of thing," said Percy. "The boat runs fast and just below the surface. Basically invisible to any kind of radar, and too quiet for most sonar. Good for...small shipments?"

"Aye, 'specialty shipments' --- when stuff has to be got somewhere fast with no fucking questions asked. Just not too much stuff. I also built in a few special modifications --- this boat is the fastest and most versatile in its class!" 

Percy looked at the rusting bulbous hulk alongside her boat and doubted there was any class of vessel that would accept it. 

Shakes continued, "Most of these homemade jobs just run at the surface; I added some batteries and some trim tanks, and this here boat --- the _Gnat_ is the name --- can _dive_. Run a bit under water, just enough to get away from any curious onlookers."

"How deep?" asked Hemi.

"Maybe 30 meters on a good day, if you really pushed it. You don't have to go very deep to hide something so small."

"How fast?" Hemi could not deny his curiosity now.

Shakes grinned. "Faster than this fuckin' barge," he said, kicking the toe of his rubber boot against the hull of the _Prospect_. 

Percy frowned. "Welp, that's an impressive submersible hobby you got there. But has anyone here got an idea how we're going to get my boat moving? You ain't carrying a load of diesel fuel, are you, Mr. Shakes?"

"Captain Shakes, if you fuckin' please. And I certainly ain't got fuel to spare. And I can't say what I _am_ carrying, ceptin' that I can't see how any of it could help you. Still, if I can do anything to assist, I'm game --- at least if there's a little something in it for me. I'm pretty convinced y'all ain't some Authority ruse, and we smugglers gotta stick together, I fucking say."

"We're not smugglers," said Percy, her eye firmly locked on Shakes. "We're independent logistics operators."

"Ain't we fucking all!" said Shakes. "Honestly, I ain't got much in the way of ideas for ya. I was thinking maybe you were the smart ones. From what I can see y'all are fuckin' fucked. Best I can say is I could run into my destination port and send some friendly bigger ship back out for you. But that'll probably take a couple days at least."

[//]: # (### Shakes agrees to let Hemi aboard the Gnat)

"In a couple of days we'll either be sunk or in some Authority holding cell. There's gotta be a better option. Hemi?" Percy turned to him.

"Well, nothing immediately comes to mind. But that is with limited information. If a new option has arisen, it will be aboard the _Gnat_. To assess the situation, I would need to get in there and take a look at what resources you have got aboard. I'm not sure how willing you are to let me do that."

Shakes did not say anything, but pulled on his cigarette and watched the exhaled smoke quickly blown out over the water by the breeze.

"Look, we aren't the type to ask for help," Percy said, "and I hate imposing on other folks' business, just as I don't want 'em imposing on mine, but you can see we're more than a little desperate here. If you can see your way to allowing Hemi --- and just Hemi --- aboard to take some specs of your boat --- see if you're carrying anything he can use --- we'll make it up to you later. At the current moment about all we can offer you is hot food."

Shakes eyes brightened at that. "Hrm. Well, I've been eatin' nothing but cold chow straight from the can for a week now. A hot meal is maybe a stronger offer than you realize at the moment. Alright. This big guy, and him alone. And he don't look at nothing I don't want him to look at. And he don't get answers to questions I don't want to answer. No fucking pushin', right?"

"No pushing," said Hemi.

"Right. Hang back a minute, let me go look around in there first, make sure all my pornography is put away. When I give you the signal, come across."

Percy grinned as Shakes lowered himself down the side and leapt nimbly over the dangerous gap between the two boats, where the chop occasionally ground the two walls of rusting steel against each other, crushing the breath out of the cracked old fenders. He disappeared through the sail hatch of the _Gnat_.

"Interesting character," said Hemi.

"Solo operators...nobody who is comfortable spending days or weeks at sea alone --- eating fucking cold canned food no less --- ever totally has their head screwed on right. Anyway, it doesn't matter how pleasant a person he is. The question is, do you think there's anything you can do with that boat that's going to help us?"

"I am not entirely hopeful. It is not much of a craft, and is not likely to have much in the way of resources aboard. Frankly, I am surprised he is not lost and dead in the water himself."

"Find us something, Hemi. But don't do anything to set that tweaked motherfucker off while you're over there."

"I shall be like a lamb among the lions."

From the sail of the _Gnat_, Shakes's head and arm popped up and gestured. "Come on over, big guy. Mind the fuckin' gap!"

Hemi's size made for a thrilling sight as he hopped the crunching span between the two boats, but he proved just as nimble as Shakes had been. Hemi was wearing heavy but conventional leather boots, and the water washing the deck of the _Gnat_ soaked the lower part of his legs. The tweed pants of his suit turned a dark and sagging color. He stepped over the open hatch into the sail, and from where Percy was watching, it seemed for a moment like there was no way his bulk would get down that tiny hole. But Hemi lithely disappeared into the boat.

Percy gave Bastian a pull on the sleeve, and he tossed a smoked-out butt into the ocean before they climbed up the sail and back inside the _Prospect_.

"So what do you think? Ain't it the finest fuckin' boat ya ever had the pleasure of dropping inside of?" Shakes seemed genuinely proud.

"It's certainly a masterpiece of the genre," replied Hemi, even more evenly than usual.

Hemi had spent nearly his entire life among and inside filthy machines, but he had never seen anything where the grime lay down quite as thickly as this. There was literal garbage all over the deck; empty cans, candy wrappers, and various greasy machine parts all rolled back and forth with the swell. A big empty herring tin seemed intended to serve as an ashtray, but apparently had been used mostly as a target for used butts --- most of which had missed and lay scattered about. 

There were stacks of pornography --- Shakes had not bothered to hide any of it. Or at least Hemi hoped that was true, because the stacks on display were of a class so deviant that Hemi could not imagine what Shakes would have found in need of hiding.

In one space, recessed between the supports of the pressure hull, were columns of still unopened food cans. The labels had been peeled off and the contents written on them in grease pencil. Most appeared to contain some variety of highly salted pasta-and-sauce. In another recess was a bin with what must have been a hundred different types of puzzle games that all had the basic premise of requiring squares of the same color to be sorted alike. Every last puzzle was solved. 

[//]: # (Shakes is some kind of idiot-genius. And also has a lot of time on his hands.)

The controls to the sub were aligned with and partially inside of the sail. Hemi noted that the controls were airplane-style, with a single yoke that controlled both the angle and direction of the boat --- a pretty sophisticated system for any submarine, but particularly a hand-built machine.

The sail was the only place with enough headroom to stand upright. Or, at least, Shakes could stand upright there; Hemi still had to crouch a bit. Through an open hatch leading forward, Hemi could see small wooden crates crammed into the bow section. More crates were arranged behind the controls located in the middle of the boat. Shakes had thrown what were clearly his sleeping blankets over them. There was a thin heavily-stained mattress to one side, which Shakes was raising to lean against the pressure hull so there was enough room to pass the crates.

"Y'all woke me from a nap with the fuckin' ship-to-ship call. That's why I didn't see ya earlier. I suppose you want to see the engines and batteries and what-fuckin-not? They're toward the back." Shakes reached into his denim vest and withdrew a leather pouch. He pinched some dried leaves from it, stuffed them into his cheek, and masticated them slowly.

[//]: # (Shakes chews coca leaves --- he got into them building sub on the coffee farm in the mountains.)

"Yes, the engines first, if you please." Hemi squeezed past the crates and pulled a small notebook and pencil from an inside pocket of his tweed jacket. The engine was massive and took up the entire rear third of the boat. Now Hemi was genuinely impressed. "That's a lot of engine for such a small vessel."

"Took the thing out of a fuckin' tractor that had been broken down and rustin' in a coffee field for years. Had to build a gantry and borrow another tractor to haul it up the mountain to where I was building the _Gnat_ and get it installed. Direct-drive to the prop, so it's a genuine ship engine, not just a glorified generator to power an electric motor."

The configuration was obvious to Hemi. The greasy steel drive shaft came straight from the back end of the diesel, ran along the centerline of the boat, and passed out through the stern, like a needle piercing an egg resting on its side.

"But you said it has batteries, too? The boat can swim underwater?"

"Sure. The direct-shaft drive means I've gotta have a transmission, of course. I worked with a mechanical genius who lived on the coffee farm to build this fancy-ass transmission that lets me switch over to that electric motor to drive.  It's a fuckin' hassle, though, I try to avoid it, 'cept in emergencies. I have to leave the controls and come back here to the engines, switch out the diesel, and manually engage the electric motor with these levers. And the electric motor is small --- it's slow, though fuckin' silent as a sunken graveyard."

"It is the finest piece of mountain-top engineering I've ever seen on the sea," Hemi said honestly. "Is that an escape trunk back there?"

"Yessir. Never know what you might need to be flushin' out of the fuckin' boat, including meself."

"And where are the batteries?"

"Eh, batteries, fuel, ballast tanks are all below these deck panels. You have to pull them up to get at them. Since I rarely use the electric motor, the batteries almost always have a full charge on them --- as they do right now --- if that helps somehow. Obviously not enough juice to power your giant fuckin' washtub over there."

"No, not nearly. How much fuel do you have?"

"Wellsir, this is how we check that..." Shakes slipped his finger through a metal ring atop a pipe that ran up from the deck along the curve of the wall. He pulled a long wavering piece of thin steel from the pipe and wiped it on a foul rag that hung on a hook on the wall. He replaced the dipstick and then quickly pulled it back out again and held it up for Hemi to see the graduation along its length.

Hemi winced as he caught an acrid whiff of petrochemicals. "You buy decent quality fuel oil, Captain Shakes?"

"Ah well fuck, you know, I buy whatever I can get at the trading posts. I'm sure they're sometimes selling me chunky bunker with the used oil from the cafeteria deep fryer dumped on top. But ain't that what the fuckin' fuel filter is for?" Shakes kicked at a rust-flaked cylinder mounted on a pipe that ran back toward the engine. "I consider it good quality fuel if I don't hafta siphon water out of the bottom of the tank after a top-up." 

"Indeed. And how long will that amount of fuel oil you have there last you?" Hemi asked, pointing the eraser side of his pencil at the dripping dipstick Shakes was still holding between them.

"Maybe twelve hours' worth left. Enough to get me where I'm fuckin' going."

"Where are you going?"

"I think I'm gonna keep that bit a' information to myself for the moment." Shakes set the dipstick back in its pipe.

Hemi made a sound in his throat while he scribbled some calculations. He pointed to a gauge in front of the control yoke. "Is that the battery charge?"

"Such as it is. That's salvaged from tractor parts too. It shows me roughly how much charge is left on the battery, but mostly it's just got a fuckin' little red light that comes on when the batteries are about to kick off. If ya want any fuckin' precision, you gotta get down under those deck panels with the meter and take readings off each of the battery banks." Shakes kicked a small steel door that opened to a recessed cabinet in the wall. He pulled from the space a short pry bar and a small metal box with a dial gauge and a pair of electrical leads dangling from it. "Check this shit out." He levered the teeth of the prybar under the steel deck panel. Hemi stood on the other side and they lifted the panel together and propped it up.

Below were rows and rows of what Hemi was almost certain were lead-acid truck or tractor batteries. A rat's nest of greasy black cables ran back and forth between them.

Hemi scratched his beard. "Well! Let me see that meter." He lowered himself to his knees and reached out over the battery banks with the leads from the meter. He began touching the probes to various terminals on the batteries and writing down the results he read off the meter in his little notebook. "This is going to take a while."

"Always fuckin' does." Shakes took a comb from his pocket and dipped it in a bucket half-filled with oil that dripped from the diesel engine. He ran the comb through his hair, then teased it back up to a spiky randomness with the tips of his fingers. He wiped his fingers on his shirt. "So...where were _you_ guys headed, before the whole fuckin' dead-ship thing?" 

Hemi did not look up from his work. "Captain Percy has been playing that particular piece of information close to her chest since we left the last port. I believe she has a line on our next job, but she has not yet shared details with me," He said somewhat tentatively. He continued silently checking the status of the batteries while Shakes pulled a pack of cigarettes from his vest and lit one to chase down the flavor of the leaves he had been chomping on.

After Shakes had filled up the small space with a haze of tobacco smoke, Hemi sat up straight and stashed his notebook and pencil back in his pocket. "I think I have enough information for the time being. That food Gregory was working on is probably ready. Shall we go see if we can find something hot to eat?"

"Shit ya. My gut is a gaping hole. Help me get this panel back in place." Shakes tossed the remaining bit of burning cigarette in the direction of the ashtray, and Hemi helped him replace the panel.

[//]: # (### A meal aboard the Prospect)

Shakes and Hemi came into the galley of the _Prospect_, where Percy and Bastian were already crammed into the tight seating around the table. Gregory was at the stove, working a giant cast iron pan so heavy with frying rice that the wiry muscles of his arm bulged with the effort of shaking it.

[//]: # (Would they have a gas range on a sub? Or would it be electric. If electric, would they waste power cooking food? Maybe we shall just leave that little tidbit unaddressed.)

Gregory looked up when Hemi and Shakes came in. Hemi introduced Shakes.

"Fuck yeah," said Shakes, eyeing the pile of frying rice. "I ain't eaten nothing but cold canned pasta for more than a week."

"None of your canned garbage food here, Captain Shakes," said Gregory, grinding the pan back and forth across the range in a way that set small sparks flying. "Gotta keep it moving or it'll burn to the bottom. This is real submariner's food. Everything good that can't go bad: rice, eggs, cabbage..."

"Are you putting that foul slimy-gray pickled cabbage in the rice again, Gregory?" asked Bastian. "You'll be killing submariners if submariner's food is that fucking real."

Gregory huffed. "My ol' pap worked a submarine galley in the wars. He used to say, 'If you can heat it, you can eat it.' And this shit's gonna be plenty fucking hot." Gregory dumped in an entire container of the questionable pickled cabbage and stirred it around as the sound of frying drowned out any conversation.

He declared the rice done a few minutes later. "Captain Shakes, for helping us out, you're up first." Gregory cracked an egg onto a smoking smaller frying pan next to the giant one full of rice. As it sizzled on the creosote surface, Gregory dumped huge piles of rice into a big bowl and handed it to Shakes. The rice was browned by the black salty sauces Gregory had poured into it, and burned to a crusty-black crunchiness in places. Steaming bits of cabbage slithered throughout, flecked with red and black pepper. Shakes was about to dig a fork in when Gregory slipped the fried egg on top with a spatula. Its white was stained an oily, slightly-gray color, and the glowing orange yolk was held in place by a wiggling skin on the edge of bursting from the pressure of the hot liquid inside.

Shakes grinned before plunging the tines of his fork into the yolk and letting it run into his rice. He then started working his way into his bowl with an uninterrupted shoveling motion of his fork from the bowl to his mouth.

Gregory served up the rest of the crew the same way. Percy asked him to run up to the control room and get on the PA and tell Owen to come up for some grub.

Hemi sat at the end of the table with his little notebook propped open in front of him, eating his rice with one hand while scribbling down calculations with the other.

Their hunger got the better of any conversation for a few minutes as the mounds of rice, egg, and cabbage steadily vanished. Gregory served himself and sat down, and got back up a few minutes later to fry another egg for Owen when he arrived. A few minutes after that, he had to get up to make Shakes another egg. All told, every one of them had at least two servings and Owen and Shakes each ate three. Gregory never got to sit for more than a minute. And when no more eggs were demanded, he got up again to put coffee on.

Between forkfuls of rice, Percy tried to get an assessment of the situation on her boat. "Owen, have you been down in the cargo hold?" 

Owen nodded, his crop fully loaded. 

"How's the patch looking?"

Owen swallowed, and then swallowed again. "I'm hardly an expert on welding or repairs, but I'd say it looks pretty bad. The patches are an ugly mess, and I'm pretty sure the water level is rising again, though more slowly."

"Can you work on it? Can you clean up those welds, get the leaking stopped?" Percy asked.

"I can try. But, you know, it's delicate work that I'm just starting to figure out. There's a chance I could just make it worse --- burn a hole right through the hull. If you're asking me, I think you need Chips on it."

"I didn't ask your opinion, you little shit. I asked if you can fix it," said Percy, aiming her fork at him.

"Yeah, Captain Percy. No fuckin' sweat." Owen poked at his food a little less hungrily.

"Finish your food and get your skinny ass back down there."

"Sylvia," Hemi said, not looking up from his food, "I really think you need to do what you can to get Chips back to working on those repairs."

She smacked her fist on the table and looked up, breathing through her nostrils. "Fuck."

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### A plan)

Owen took his coffee to go and headed for the cargo hold to try and reinforce Chips' patches. When there was finally a cup of coffee in front of everyone remaining in the galley, and the empty bowls had been pushed into the middle of the table, Percy brought them to order. "Next agenda item: assuming we don't fucking sink, how do we get my lady moving again?" She looked at Hemi.

Hemi put his pencil down. "Perhaps in your time on the sea some of you have become familiar with the Angler fish? In some species, the female is enormous compared to the male, maybe a hundred times bigger. The females are complex, highly evolved organisms, with sophisticated traps for catching and devouring other fish. The males are nothing but tiny sperm repositories. They swim around until they find a female, attach themselves to the female's underside, and then fuse with her body, essentially becoming nothing more than a sperm organ for her."

"Hemi, let's try stepping around the long-winded symbolism and get to the fucking point," Percy said.

"Here is what I propose," Hemi continued, unfazed. "The _Prospect_ has a hatch with a mating collar on the bottom side of the boat. Its normal intended use is underwater docking to another sub's topside hatch for discreet transshipping of small cargo. We could rig something so we could mate the _Gnat_ to the underside of the _Prospect_, and then feed up fuel and power into the _Prospect_ from the _Gnat_. As a male anglerfish might..."

[//]: # (So: why are they not just transferring Shakes fuel from the Gnat to the Prospect? I guess because then they would have to tow the Gnat behind them. And if it came to using the Gnats batteries, they cannot really transfer the charge over --- though maybe there is some complex way they could move the batteries over. I guess it does make some kind of vague sense to mate the two boats up. Also, being mated allows them to dive --- shallowly.)

"Got it," Percy interrupted. "And you think there's enough juice left in the _Gnat_ for...what? How far could that possibly take us?"

"How far do you want to go Sylvia?"

"Hold the fuck on a second," Shakes cut in. "what exactly do I get out of your little biology lesson, Hemi? The fundamental pin of this here plan of yours is really me casting my lot in with you loser a-holes. Basically, you're turning my boat into a reserve tank, and I'm donating all my fuel to you. And maybe even more fuckin' 'gregiously than that: I'd be giving up the independent operator's _sacred_ right to self-determination. Suddenly I'm demoted from captain of my own boat to rank-and-file in some backwater freight-trucking crew. What's the payoff for me? And it better be a whole lot more than a couple of bowls of fried rice, or I'm taking my boat rollin' on. I mean, I thought I could just sell you some batteries or something and be on my way. But yer talkin' about something quite above and beyond my fuckin' baseline generosity."

Percy blew out her cheeks. "OK, look. First: you are not going to be crew, you are our _guest_, Shakes."

"_Captain_ Shakes."

"Our guest, _Captain_ Shakes. Second, I've recently made a contact that has put me on to our possible next job, and let me say, gentlemen, it is a downright fuckin' doozy when it comes to potential profitability. You throw in with us right now _Captain_ Shakes, and it's like you're making a good bet on a large payout in the near future. Assuming you're all done gorging yourselves, let's regroup at the navigation table and I'll show you what I'm thinking."

"Anything that profitable has got to be illegal," said Shakes as they slid out from the galley table bench seats.

"As you know, what is illegal in one territory is a high-value commodity in another, at least for most cargo," said Hemi.

"Oh, I wasn't judging, just, ya know, clarifying. Regional high-value commodities are the _Gnat_'s bread and butter."

They made their way forward and regrouped around the navigation table, most still holding their tin coffee mugs. 

"So where are we now?" asked Shakes between sips.

Hemi pointed to the obvious small x at the end of a string of grease pencil dashes.

"To pick this job up, we need to reach the destination I had been aiming for before we got side-tracked," said Percy, "and that destination is here." She pointed to a small feature on the chart with a grease-stained finger.
 
Shakes set his coffee mug down on the glass covering the chart and pulled down the retractable magnifier. He leaned over the chart and read the label of the feature Percy had pointed to. "It says, 'deserted.' That's where your big fuckin' score awaits, Captain Percy? A deserted island?"
 
"It _was_ deserted when this chart was made. And the current residents would probably prefer the charts remain labeled that way. But over the last ten years or so, a small depot was built there. Look..." She took the grease pencil and drew a lightweight but long line across hundreds of miles of ocean. "The Territorial Authority boundary is roughly about here. With total assholes on this side we are currently on, and only sort-of assholes on the other. So you can see how it makes sense to put a depot on that deserted island just across the line to help facilitate trade in, out, and through Asshole-vania over here."

"The Authority on this side of the line _are_ a bunch of aggressive motherfuckin' assholes," agreed Shakes. "They must just hate having that depot there."

"That's why the proprietors would prefer the island to generally be understood as 'deserted.' And it's also why the assholes patrolling the water we're currently in are particularly unfriendly dicks to good folks like ourselves in the business of shipping. Hence my priority to get us moving again, and why we would be particularly grateful to have your assistance in that endeavor, Captain Shakes."

"Well, when you put it that way --- that particularly profitable way, I mean..."

Hemi picked up a pair of calipers and measured the distance between the small grease-pencil x and the deserted island. "About 100 nautical miles..." he muttered, mostly to himself. He set his notebook on the glass and scribbled calculations, pausing to take further measurements at some points. "We have to cut everything to the bone, but the maths says we could make it. _Could_."

"Wait a damned second, I put it to you again: what do _I_ get out of this fuckin' mechanical monstrosity of a plan?" Shakes was stabbing his finger against the table, leaving smudgy black prints on the glass.

"I can pay you up front for the fuel we take from you today Captain Shakes," said Percy, "and at the depot I'll pay you your standard hull rate, plus refill your fuel oil. So it's like you're getting paid for a full shipping run just for accompanying us to the depot."

[//]: # (Shakes hull rate is not the same as a standard hull load --- in Shakes case, it is quite a bit less. See note in comment about hull load fees in Chapter 3.)

"You mean _if_ you get into that there 'highly profitable' line though don't ya? What if you find that fuckin' line has dried up?"

"In that case, we'll have to work something else out that is within our means. You afraid of a little gambling Captain Shakes?"

"What about my current load? This little fuckin' adventure of yours is going to set me back a couple of days at least. What do I tell my current client?"

"Where is your drop-off?"

"Well, I was headed for the Longland Islands trading center. Refuel there, and then on to my drop-off destination a few days out beyond that."

"C'mon, buddy," said Bastian, "look at the fuckin' chart; it's nearly the same direction! There's no way the difference in travel time between this depot and Longland Islands is more than a day. You can tell your client you were delayed by any whatever-the-fuck-thing you want. Hell, tell them the truth. You're probably still going to be within your delivery window anyway!"

Shakes considered the chart. There was no arguing with Bastian's point.

"Plus, we will fit a nice mating collar onto the _Gnat_. You may find that to be of some use in the future," said Hemi. "Think of it as a deluxe feature."

"And hot meals 'til we get to the depot," added Gregory.

Shakes glanced at Gregory with a look that suggested he might be bought cheap if the pay satisfied his stomach.  "I need one other thing, though...I want you to keep a line open to me on any future job possibilities."

"What, like fuckin' partners?" Percy bristled.

"Fuck no. I work alone. But an operator has to have connections in this game. You'd be a big cheese for me, feeding me future prospects. That way I get long-term payoffs for my investment in your sorry-ass fuckin' futures right now."

"Alright. Any job that seems suitable for a specialty cargo hauler like yourself, I will send your way with fuckin' pleasure."

Shakes grinned. Now they were negotiating from a place he understood --- most profit is future profit. "So, ah, Hemi, what exactly are ya going to do to my beautiful little boat?"

"Well," Hemi said, looking at Percy, "first, we need to rouse Chips. She is the only one on board who might know how to fit a mating collar that could work."

Percy was grinding her teeth. "Alright, Fuck. Hemi, go see if you can rehire Chips on a _temporary_ and ad-fucking-hoc basis to do some of this welding we need. I don't want to see her though. Tell her to stay the fuck out of my way or she'll find herself swimming in the prop wash...once we're moving again."

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### They reconcile with Chips and talk about fitting mating collar to the Gnat)

Hemi loaded up another bowl of rice from the galley and led Shakes to the crew quarters, where they found Chips in her rack with the curtains drawn. 

"Chips," Hemi addressed the curtain. "I brought you some food."

"Ah, fuck you and your gestures, Hem'," came a muffled voice. "Go spoon it into that asshole you work for until she fuckin' chokes on it."

"Chips, you are certainly tough, no one would deny that. And I think that toughness comes partly from a genuine mean streak in you, and partly from the fact that you believe you know how to do things right. The problem is that Captain Percy has both of those qualities too, so just like you, she is both sometimes mean and also not going to be the one to admit when she did something wrong."

"Spare me the fuckin' you're-both-so-fuckin'-alike speech, Hemi. Just fuck off."

"I am just explaining _why_ she is not going to come apologize, Chips. I am also going to tell you I believe she was entirely wrong, and risked your life by not warning you she was going to blow the tanks. You were right, and she _should_ apologize, but you know her --- she will not."

"So fuckin' what? You think I give a shit?"

"So, I do not believe you want to die out here, just because she is never going to do the right thing and admit she made a mistake. But that is what is going to happen: we are going to sink and die on this bleak stretch of ocean right here if you do not help us. We need you to keep the welds on that patch of yours together. Please."

There was a silence. Then a small, filthy hand stuck out from behind the curtain. "Give me that food, I'm fucking starving." Hemi put the warm bowl of rice into the hand, and it withdrew. The fork clinked for a minute, and then Chips opened the curtain a little. That was when she saw Shakes. "Who the fuck is that?"

"I'm fuckin' Shakes," said Shakes.

"_Captain_ Shakes," said Hemi.

"Is that your name or how you reproduce?" asked Chips.

"Like you're one to fuckin' talk. Didn't they call you 'Chips'?"

"Look," Hemi interrupted, "we found Captain Shakes here on the surface. He has a boat --- a small sub. I want to weld a mating collar onto the sail of his boat. It has to fit to the _Prospect_'s belly mating collar. I want to attach his boat to the underside and run with it that way. This is another project we cannot do without you. Think you could rig something like that?"

"Well, fuck. I might have some scrap steel that could do that. Depends on what the hatch on his boat looks like, so I'll have to fuckin' eyeball that. Possible it could be done." She thought for a second. "But that's a fuckin' tricky bit of sonar listening to make that mating work, steerin' the boat up from underneath, like. You think you got the fuckin' skills to do that Captain Shakes?"

"I've squeezed that boat through any number of tight places --- narrow fuckin' gaps pushing through Authority anti-sub fencing and the like. I'm as good a sub pilot as there ever fuckin' was."

"His boat, the _Gnat_, has a viewport in the sail. He should be able to see enough to execute the mating maneuver without the aid of sonar," said Hemi.

"A fuckin' window on a submarine. Stupidest fuckin' thing I ever heard. Fuckin' crazy shit ya want to pull here. Look, Hem', you're right about me not wanting to die out here. Way I figure it is, to best push that priority forward, I gotta spend my time workin' on my fucking patch in the cargo hold. I may in fact spend the rest of my short fuckin' life working on that fuckin' patch. I ain't got time to be up there fuckin' around with welding scrap steel onto what --- and I'm just taking a wild fucking guess here --- is some barely-afloat rusting sea-tractor." She paused. "You might get Owen to do it."

"The kid?" asked Shakes. "Fuck that. If there's welding to be done, I'll weld my own boat."

"She is right though," said Hemi. "The patch in the _Prospect_ needs more work. If it fails, it could take both boats down. Before you do go back to your patch, though, Chips, get Owen and go out with Captain Shakes and take a look at the _Gnat_. Make sure they have what they need to get this done right. It is not going to help us much if the mating collar leaks and floods the _Gnat_. Have Owen haul up the spare welding rig." 

"Aye, Hem'," she said, clearly understanding that what Hemi actually meant was that she should instruct Shakes on how to do the job correctly. She swung down from her bunk, handing Hemi her empty food bowl. "And fuck you for workin' around my bad mood by siccing me on a right mechanical challenge. Come on, _Captain_ Shakes, we'll go find the fuckin' kid and have a look at this boat of yours."

[//]: # (### Hemi and Percy put someone on radar)

Hemi found Percy sitting at the sonar station with the headset on, listening. When she saw Hemi, she pulled one earpiece off. "That go OK?"

"Yes. Shakes says he is going to do the welding on the _Gnat_, and Chips wants to keep working on the _Prospect_'s patch."

"I'm glad she came to her fucking senses."

"Her senses had little to do with it."

Percy ignored that. "What's next?"

"I wanted to look at the chart and run my numbers again."

"Alright. We should put someone on radar; I don't want any Authority craft sneaking up on us."

"Put Gregory or Bastian on it." 

"Yeah. Alright, I'll get Bastian in here. Better than fucking nobody."

"Send Gregory out to help Owen and Shakes. Welding the mating collar onto the _Gnat_ is going to be something of a tricky operation."

"Right." Percy climbed to the control room to rouse her crew on the PA.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### Back on deck, with the cargo hold hatch open, lifting the welding rig and welding the Gnat mating collar)

On the forward deck of the _Prospect_, Owen had opened the watertight doors of the big cargo hatch. This left a wide hole down into the cavernous space of the cargo hold, which was the only way to get the heavy welding rig out of the boat. He had assembled a small tripod gantry over the hole, from which he had hung a hefty chain hoist. Gregory was down in the cargo hold, securing the end of the chain to the welding rig. When he had it ready, he gave Owen the thumbs up.

"Hey Gregory," Owen called down to him, "while I'm hauling the welding rig up, take a look around: we still need the material for the mating collar. And get the gangway into position --- I'll need it to wheel this fucking thing across to the _Gnat_. Also get the long power cables for the welding rig, some heavy clamps, and a welding mask." Owen looked across at the deck of the _Gnat_, where the chop washed over while Chips and Shakes drew lines on the top of the sail with a grease pencil. "Uh...better get those fucking rubber waders too." He lit a cigarette and started hauling the welding rig up, hand-over-hand. "This isn't going to be easy," he said to himself through the cigarette hanging from his lips. Each long pull on the chain only eased the welding rig below upward by a matter of centimeters, as the lifting capabilities of the chain were both augmented and slowed by the wheels it looped through.

When he finally got the welding rig suspended over the deck, he gave it a little kick, and when it swung back, he let the chain out and grabbed the rig as it touched the deck and tilted back toward the hole. This was actually a two-person job: a mistake would mean a ten-meter drop into the cargo hold, and probably being maimed or killed.

Owen wheeled the welding rig away from the cargo hatch and aligned its wheels with the deck of the _Prospect_ so it would not tilt off into the ocean. By the time he got back over the open hole to the cargo hold, Gregory had returned underneath with the gangway. Lashed to the railings of the gangway were the various other things Owen had asked for. Owen dropped the end of the chain down to him, and Gregory clipped it to one end of the gangway. "Hold on, I'll come up and help you haul it." He disappeared toward the stern of the boat.

With Gregory helping to pull the chain through, they hauled the gangway vertically up to the mouth of the cargo hatch and out onto the deck, and got it lashed into place connecting the higher deck of the _Prospect_ to the low, wet deck of the _Gnat_.

[//]: # (### They plan the mating collar)

Chips waved Owen over. "Thanks for doing that fuckin' gangway. It'll be a lot easier getting back to the _Prospect_." She grinned her rarely-seen, wide-mouthed, slightly gapped-tooth grin at Owen. "Alright, look here, this is the plan Shakes and I got worked out, and ya should be glad Shakes is doing it. It's going to be a fuckin' nightmare if it works, and like a fuckin' wet, squirtin', languish in the head if it don't." She pointed to the top of the sail. "We fuckin' lucked out, though. Shakes here built the sail fat enough across the beam that we can make the welds fuckin' flat. Ya just need a piece of steel cylinder of the right diameter. Cut it even, then weld it around the hatch opening. And then weld those spare male docking clamps we got onto the sides of the cylinder."

"How am I going to get a cylinder the right diameter?"

"Worst case, you have to weld it together out of overlapping curved pieces. But I think I might have a hunk of steel tube in the scrap pile left over from repairs to the mating collar on the _Prospect_ a while back. In that case we might --- if you're a fuckin' lucky son-of-uh-ho-ar --- have something exactly the right fucking diameter already."

Owen nodded. "And how're the docking clamps going to be activated? They're electro-magnetic, right?"

"Yeah," said Shakes. "We'll need to drill some through-hull fittings. That sucks, but it shouldn't be too hard to make them watertight to thirty meters, which is what I usually call the depth limit of the _Gnat_. And if they do happen to leak...well, they'll be pretty small leaks. A boat that don't leak isn't a boat, it's like, a fuckin' airplane, or something."

"Since we're going to be dragging the _Gnat_ along by the mating collar," Owen said, "seems like we should also weld some supports on the outside of the collar, down the sail, and directly to the structural elements of the hull. It'll be ugly as fuck, but less likely to leave the _Gnat_ ripped away from the collar." 

"Ugly-as-fuck is my other name," said Shakes.

"Listen to the kid, Capt' Shakes. He's gettin' a fuckin' touch for this stuff," said Chips.

"Hey, offer all the advice you want, but I'm the one who puts the fuckin' torch to my boat, got it?"

"Good by me. I'll leave ya stupid fuckers to it. I got my own welding to do." Chips gave them a casual salute and made her way along the gangway to the _Prospect_.

"I'll get Gregory digging through that scrap steel, see if he can find that tube she was talkin' about," Owen said.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### They weld the mating collar)

This was going to be an extremely tough job. Not as tough, Owen reminded himself, as welding the pressure hull back together under water, like Chips was currently doing, but nobody would do this job on the _Gnat_ if they did not have to. Owen had wheeled the welding rig across the gangway, and that had only been modestly harrowing. Connecting it to the _Gnat_'s questionable electrical system and lashing it to the sloshing hull had been somewhat more so. Owen set Shakes up with everything he needed, handing him tools one by one like a nurse supporting a surgeon opening a consumptive rib cage.

The ocean chop was not horrendous, but it was enough that the _Gnat_ rolled back and forth under them. Owen had locked huge iron clamps in place that held the work material to the sail. The water washing over the deck sometimes smacked against the sail and shot up right where Shakes was welding.

Shakes stood astride his boat, lolling in the surface of the sea just as someone might stand on a mountaintop. He took a pinch of dried leaves from the pouch in his jacket pocket and stuck them between his teeth. He lit a cigarette and put it to his lips. He leveled the mask on his head and slipped the heavy welding gloves onto his hands. He picked up the torch and, standing straight up, opened his arms wide and closed his eyes. He took long slow breaths through lips gapped beside his cigarette, his breathing rattling a little with the spittle coming up to digest the leaves in his cheek. He cleared his mind and focused on his breathing. He felt the swell and rhythm of the ocean, the time marked out by the clink of the adjustable wrenches hanging from his belt. He called the gods of steady hands and perfect welds to him.

He opened his eyes, spat the remaining half of the cigarette off into the ocean, leaned over, and flipped down the welding mask. 

And with a flash of blue arc, he proceeded to lay down the foulest, globbing booger-weld Owen had ever seen. Smoking masses of material built up on top of smoking masses, curled over and gooped around in carbon-coated black curves. Shakes gripped the welding stick fiercely, the muscles of his forearms tensed. The tip wavered back and forth across the line the weld was supposed to follow so that it looked like he might be trying to sign the work rather than repair it.

Shakes welded, went back over his work, and welded more. It grew uglier and uglier, globs upon globs of congealed molten metal. The wash of the sea continually soaked the two men in cold water. Every few minutes Shakes had to stop welding so Owen could move the clamps. Since the seam needed to be watertight, Owen wanted to keep it press-fit in place with the clamps at all times. He knew that that starting and stopping like that was bad for a welder who wanted to make a clean, strong weld. But since Shakes's welds were about the worst he'd ever seen, that seemed like the least of his problems. The hot welds steamed when the water ran over them, which Owen was pretty sure would not contribute to the strength of the welding.

"You...built this boat?" Owen asked Shakes when he raised his head up for a break. 

"Aye fuckin' ya. On a mountain top."

"And...it doesn't leak...too much?"

"Ah well, ye know there's always gonna be 'nother leak. I just patch em and keep fuckin' movin'."

"Lot of patches?"

"Sometimes it seems like it's more patch than original boat. But then, since it was built from scraps, it has always been a fuckin' quilty kinda thing."

By the time they finished welding the support struts down the side of the hull, the new mating collar looked like a bipedal birthday cake, frosted by a toddler using a cancerous mixture of coke and pitch. 

"You think that'll hold?" Owen asked, looking at the mess doubtfully.

"Aw, hells ya. Look at how much material we welded into that thing! See, an engineer can build a thing to an exact fuckin' spec and --- if they're a real right good fuckin' engineer --- that thing will perform the way they expect it to, in all the situations they expect it to. The thing is, that don't mean it will perform in situations the engineer _don't_ expect. That's why I always _overbuild_ things, far beyond any spec --- so I'll be ready for what I don't expect."

Owen orienteered his way up and down following the thread of that logic, and eventually decided it made absolute sense. "Well, nothing like holding a welding project underwater and dragging it along at a few knots to test the quality of your work."

"Aye, that's what we'll be fuckin' doing fer sure, when once we got the _Gnat_ set up dragging under your boat over there. Why don't you go tell that big Hemi guy we're ready here."

[//]: # (### They lower the boat)

Getting all the gear from the welding operation stowed back in the cargo hold took longer than expected. The chop was building a bit, which made doing anything aboard the _Gnat_ more difficult. Once Hemi saw all the odds and ends stowed below and checked the main cargo hatch seal, he went to the forward end of the cargo hold to see how Chips was coming along on her work.  She was welding yet more scraps of metal patches over the still-leaking wound in the pressure hull. Thankfully, the water level had at least receded enough that Chips was wading instead of swimming. 

Percy came walking down the cargo hold and met up with Hemi at the water's edge in the forward end. Chips looked up and glared at her but immediately went back to her welding.

"We are ready to try this connecting up the _Gnat_ move," Hemi said to Percy.

"Good," said Percy through an exhale of cigarillo smoke. Her eyes were bloodshot and her entire face drooping and wan from lack of sleep. She had another cup of coffee in her hand. "Need anything else from me when you try the mating?"

"I do not think so. But it will go much easier for Shakes if we can put the _Prospect_ in motion and lower the deck under --- just run sail-up. At that depth the waves will have a lot less effect on the motion of the boat." 

Chips looked up from her work again when she heard this.

"Do we have the battery left for that?" asked Percy

"Ten minutes at a creep speed, maybe? I believe we can just manage it. I am more worried about whether we have enough fine control over the buoyancy to lower the boat just a few meters like that."

"But if we can run at sail-up depth, we'll also be a much harder to spot target as we head for the depot."

"Ah, fuck ya both, ya leaking assholes!" Chips interrupted from where she was standing in the water. "Yer determined to fuckin' sink us! Are ya forgetting the high-pressure system is fucking depleted? I doubt there's enough fuckin' pressure left for a full blow if something goes wrong. Fuck --- there's probably also not enough fuckin' power in the batteries to bring us back to the surface with the fuckin' low-pressure system! We'll be lucky to fuckin be leapin' out the top of the sail as it lowers away under us heading for the fuckin' bottom!"

Percy just stared at Chips, her mouth a hard line.

"I agree, Chips," said Hemi. "It is dangerous. But so is running slow with engines blaring full-up on the surface if we manage to get the _Gnat_ attached. We would be a big fat radar _and_ sonar target. We need the advantage lowering the boat down will give us."

"Aye well, yer both fuckin' suicidal, and murder-fucking-cidal --- since yer trying to drag me down against my will. To lower the boat you gotta open the main fuckin' ballast valves, of course. What the fuck happens if they don't fuckin' close again though, eh? Then we are just letting all the fucking buoyancy out of the boat with no way to put it back."

"There is no reason to think the valves will not close," Hemi said. 

"And you, Chips, will go double-check those devices our lives depend on before we try this operation," said Percy, her eyes grinding away at Chips.

"The fuckin' problem," said Chips, furious and exasperated, "is there's no fucking back-up plan --- no fail-safe, no redundancy. The boat works perfect-like, or we all fuckin' die. Submarinin' is just too fuckin' dangerous for no backup-system."

"We are not disputing that Chips," said Hemi, as calm as always, "but sinking is only one of the risks we face right now. Go check the ballast tank valves --- make sure you are confident they will work the way they are supposed to. When you are satisfied they will work, let me know, and we will put the top deck underwater."

[//]: # (### Explaining the mating procedure)

Ten minutes later, Chips climbed up into the control room and reported to Hemi, interspersed with much swearing, that the main ballast valves should work as expected, at least as far as her limited ability to test them without sinking the boat would allow. Hemi checked over the state of their batteries and other systems and noted everything with a pencil on a clipboard. He got on the external PA and called Shakes to the control room.

Shakes appeared on the bridge at the top of the _Prospect_'s sail. He looked down at Hemi through the open hatch into the control room and called to him,  "Ya fuckin' ready Hemi?"

"Almost. I need you to take the _Gnat_ off a hundred meters or so. We are going to bring the _Prospect_ down to just sail-out, and creep at two knots. We will hold it steady. Then it is all you: dive the _Gnat_, come up underneath, you should see the mating collar just about under where the sail would be on the bottom --- about one-third of the way forward from the stern. Bring the _Gnat_ up under, and _gently_ pop your mating collar into ours, and if you boys did not miss on the location of the docking clamps by too much, you should be able to lock into the hull of the _Prospect_...like a male angler fish."

Shakes raised his middle finger and held it out in front of him, toward Hemi.

"...When you are clamped on, bang on your hatch with one of those wrenches of yours. I will have Gregory down there waiting to hear from you. Do _not_ open the hatch until Gregory bangs back, OK? Even in its current condition, the _Prospect_ will do a lot better if your welds leak than the _Gnat_ will. Keep in touch over the ship-to-ship."

Shakes pounded his acknowledgment on the side of the sail, and his head disappeared from the bridge. It still remained so quiet aboard the _Prospect_, with no engines and so few systems running, that they could hear the _Gnat_'s diesels fire up, and inarticulate shouts from Shakes to Gregory on the deck as Shakes cast off the lines and Gregory retrieved them and pulled up the fenders.

"Hey-fucking-ho!" Shakes' voice came crackling over the ship-to-ship. "I'm fired up, buttoned up, and off fuckin' motoring. Out."

Hemi pulled down the ship-to-ship mic. "Got it, Shakes. Remember, _gentle_ is the word."

"I'm allllways fuckin' genteel."

"We are going to take the _Prospect_ down to sail-out depth now. Hold tight until I give you the go."

[//]: # (### they dive to sail-out depth)

Hemi got on the ship PA and flipped the switch for both internal and external speakers. "Gregory, lock down all the external hatches as you come back inside. Owen and Bastian, come up to the control room --- we are going to dive the boat to sail-out depth."

Moments later the entire crew converged on the control room. 

Percy looked at Chips, knowing the question she wanted to ask was obvious and unnecessary, but she asked it anyway. "Why the fuck are you here?"

"If we fuckin' go down, I want to be right next to you when you know death is on you, Captain Percy. I want to be able to look you in the eye when tell you: I fuckin' told ya so," said Chips.

"On every trip to hell, Chips, a crowd of people stand on shore waving. And they shout their goodbyes, but they don't say 'bon voyage', they say 'I told you so,'" replied Percy. "If you're gonna be up here, sit at the radar and let us know if we're going to have a surprise audience for this operation." 

Percy waited for Gregory to clear the ladder from the control room on his way to the lowest deck of the boat with his instructions from Hemi before she climbed up into the control room, which was once again at capacity with its full complement of four people.

"OK, Bastian. Give us a two-knot creep. We want just enough to keep us steady against the motion of the water," said Hemi. 

Bastian nudged the throttle forward, and they heard the hum of the electric motors rise from the depths of the boat as the propeller came under torque. 

Percy pulled the ship-to-ship mic. "Shakes, we are going to try submerging the hull now. If you see the sail disappear, this boat is never coming back up."

"Right," Shakes' voice crackled. "I won't wait around for another meal then."

Percy hung the mic back on its nubbin. "OK, you know what the old submariners say: always do the stupidest things on the smallest amount of sleep." She nodded to Hemi. 

"Owen, open the main ballast valves," Hemi said.

Owen swiveled his chair to face the tank control panel and gave a quarter turn to both of the small wheels that opened the valves at the same time. They could hear the hiss of air escaping up through the main ballast valves ahead of the sail as sea water pushed up into the ballast tanks from below and displaced the air into the atmosphere above.

"Just a thin hair of down angle on the dive planes, if you please," said Hemi.

Owen was ready for this; he had been resting one hand on the large wheel that controlled the dive planes. He rolled it a short distance around its circumference.

"As soon as you feel the angle on the boat Owen, level it back out again." By the time Hemi had said this, there was already a slight angle down on the bow. 

From the radar station below they could hear Chips muttering. "No fuckin' redundant system, no fucking second chance at all..."

Owen already had the dive planes leveled out again and the slight angle came off the _Prospect_'s deck. Owen and Hemi were watching the depth gauge closely as it slowly lifted off its pin. When it indicated a couple of meters of depth, Hemi reached over and rolled shut the control wheels of the main ballast tank valves himself. They all listened for the sound of hissing, escaping air to stop. No one breathed as the sound went on longer than it seemed like it should. But it wavered, slowed, and ceased as the valves came to their closed position.

"Give it another minute...make sure everything is where it should be..." said Hemi. 

The boat held at its shallow depth, the deck fully submerged and most of the sail still above the surface. Percy reached up to pat Hemi's huge shoulder. In some ways it seemed like such a small thing --- a basic maneuver they had done a thousand times before. But Hemi, at least, knew Chips was right: what was usually so routine was, in this case, incredibly risky. He felt a tremendous release of the tension that he had not quite known had come on him when the main ballast valves opened. But everything had worked the way it was supposed to.

"Good," said Percy, satisfied. "We didn't sink her by flooding the main ballast. Now let's see if we can do it by opening a hole in the bottom plugged with nothing but a rusty bucket of a home-made boat."

[//]: # (### Mating the gnat to the prospect)

Hemi got on the ship-to-ship. "Captain Shakes, we are holding at sail-out depth, two-knot forward creep. I think you can begin your dive now."

"Fuckin' righto," came Shakes' crackling reply.

Percy raised the periscope and swiveled around until she could see the tiny, nearly-invisible gray sail of the _Gnat_ bobbing in the gray water off their port side. It picked up speed, and a little wake formed behind it. Then it shrank down and disappeared under the surface like a sun winking out at the horizon. She lowered the periscope back down.

"I'm gonna get on sonar," she said. 

Hemi nodded.

Percy slipped down the ladder and tapped Chips on the shoulder. "Chips, I think it would be good if you joined Gregory in the bottom of the boat. And bring a welding rig down there with you...just in case."

"If you're fuckin' staying in this room, I'm happy to go somewhere else." Chips went forward toward the cargo hold to find her welding rig.

Percy sat in the seat vacated by Chips and glanced at the empty radar scope to make sure it remained empty. She put the sonar headphones on and turned the directional control until she could hear the soft buzz of the _Gnat_'s electric motor. Shakes was lining up directly behind the _Prospect_, slightly deeper and with more speed. She could follow his progress with a fair amount of precision through the sonar and its range finder. But he disappeared for a minute when he moved into their wake where the sonar could not hear anything. In another minute she expected to hear the _Gnat_ directly underneath the _Prospect_.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

On board the _Gnat_, Shakes leaned his head down at a painful angle, looking up through the small viewport and trying to see exactly where he was in relation to the hulking gray wall slowly parting the waters above him.

"Fuuuuuck. They shoulda mentioned that this would be stupidly fuckin' dangerous," Shakes said to himself. "I walked right into this, I guess. Or maybe they are like a backyard bully in a pool, tormenting me --- the scrawny kid --- by holding my head underwater... Though I suppose some people must be into that sort of thing." He glanced at the stacks of porn at his feet.

"Captain Shakes." Hemi's voice came over the ship-to-ship with all the bass notes stripped out of it. "Do not forget that since we are moving, you are going to have to give your boat a little more motor when you get within a meter of the _Prospect_ or so. We are going slow enough that it should not be too dramatic, but you also do not want to get sucked back into the _Prospect_'s propellers."

"Aye, fuck you all," he did not bother to respond on the radio, his hands too busy with the controls of the _Gnat_. "This little boat weren't built for this shit. Handles like a fucking beach ball underwater."

He was pushing up from behind, moving slightly faster than the _Prospect_. Through the viewport, he could just see the little black circle of the mating collar he was shooting for. He realized now that he would lose sight of it when he got closer and the target slipped beyond his ability to crane his neck. 

He squeezed the ballast blow handle in a short burst, and the _Gnat_ popped up an entire meter closer to the underside of the _Prospect_. "Ugh, too fuckin' much, too fuckin' fast. _Gently_ --- was what Hemi said --- gently..." 

He was slowly gaining on the _Prospect_. When the _Prospect_'s mating collar disappeared beyond the frame of the viewport, Shakes guessed he was directly underneath it. He gave the _Gnat_'s small dive planes a modest amount of up-angle. Suddenly he was within a meter of the _Prospect_'s belly, and he could feel the push of water from the moving hull of the big boat driving the _Gnat_ backwards. The push was also ruining his instinctive awareness of where he was. He felt a slight panic, until the mating collar popped into view again through the narrow viewport directly ahead of him. 

He gave the _Gnat_ a little more power to the electric motor, and it moved forward through the streaming water. He held close to the _Prospect_. The _Gnat_ slowly gained ground until the mating collar disappeared over his head again. He angled the dive planes up a bit, and with a loud clang the mating collars of the two ships collided.

Shakes squeezed the ballast blow handle again --- with as short a burst as he could possibly get. This gave the _Gnat_ enough buoyancy to hold it firmly up against the bottom of the _Prospect_.

He visualized what was happening in his head: the two mating collars were pressed against each other, held together but not aligned. If Shakes could correctly guess which direction to move the _Gnat_, the mating collar would pop into place. If he guessed wrong, the _Gnat_ would slip off the _Prospect_'s mating collar and crunch up against the bottom of the bigger boat. If that happened --- and he was lucky enough that his welds did not rip apart and sink him --- he would have to begin the whole maneuver over again.

He slowly eased the controls, a little rudder port, a little rudder starboard, a little forward power, a little off the throttle. He was moving the mating collar around in a circle, trying to get it to slip into the _Prospect_'s collar. There was the sound of steel ring grinding on steel ring, until with another clang, the small sub popped upwards. All he could see out of his viewport now was the long undistinguished gray hull of the _Prospect_ stretched out in front of him. Either he was in the mating collar, or had slipped off the front of it. 

But it felt right. Shakes gave a tiny further squeeze on the main ballast blow so that the _Gnat_ would have good strong upward buoyancy against the bottom of the _Prospect_. 

The way to know for sure if the two rings were mated properly was by using the docking clamps. He flipped the exposed switch he and Owen had installed. With a small blue spark, it connected the circuit that ran up the thick wires, through the holes they had drilled and sealed into the sail, to the mating clamps. He heard a third clang, and a green bulb next to the switch lit. If he had missed the mating collar, the clamps would not have closed, so he knew he was on. To be sure, he disengaged the electric motor to let the prop spin freely. When he did so, he could feel the bow of the _Gnat_ bend downward a small amount in a way that slightly sickened him, but the speed indicator did not change. The _Gnat_ was being dragged by the _Prospect_. 

He pulled up the ship-to-ship mic toward his mouth, "Hemi, I think I'm fuckin' on."

"Yes. We can feel the drag up here. We are going to trim our tanks to adjust for the pull of the _Gnat_ hanging on, and then shut down our engines to save our batteries. I think you can give a bang on your hatch now, and see if Chips can open up the junction between us."

[//]: # (### The hatch needs to be repaired)

In the deepest part of the _Prospect_, in the narrow hall between the forward and rear battery rooms with heavy watertight bulkhead doors on either side, Gregory and Chips sat on the deck on either side of a well. Gregory had pulled up the steel grating that normally covered this well and set it to one side. The grating had been locked into place with a sliding mechanism that could only be opened with a key Percy carried. This was a precaution against anyone opening the hatch below without the permission of the captain, since, under certain circumstances, opening this particular hatch could sink the boat. Gregory had had to borrow the key from Percy to unlock the grating. Now they sat with their feet dangling down into the well. Gregory tapped the toe of his boot lightly on the still-closed hatch while they waited for the signal from Shakes.

"Ehhh, Chips, should we close and seal this watertight bulkhead door behind me here? Seems like if Shakes' welds fail completely when we open this hatch --- and worse case, say, the _Gnat_ tears away or something --- we'll be flooding the whole _Prospect_ from this hole we're opening in the bottom of the boat, eh?" Gregory's voice was tinged with nerves.

"Doesn't fuckin' work like that, so you can calm the fuck down. As long as they got the top hatch in the fuckin' sail closed, there's not enough pressure at this depth to drive in enough water to sink the boat. Still, I got my fucking bulkhead hatch closed and sealed on this side. If it starts flooding fast, we are going out your door and closing it the fuck behind us. There's no fuckin' way we're sealing our fuckin' selves in here and risking being fuckin' heroes to save this ship."

"Alright, I'm following you then, Chips."

"Keep that fuckin' portable bilge pump ready though: if there's a small leak, then some modest fuckin' heroics will be required of us."

At this point they could hear the _Gnat_ grinding against the mating collar of the _Prospect_, screeching metal-on-metal as it moved back and forth trying to find the docked position. And then there was the loud crunch of the two boats coming together.

"Sound's like he's on," said Chips. "We wait till we get the fuckin' OK from Hemi though."

Gregory nodded.

They could feel the shuddering vibrations of the _Gnat_'s motor through the hull of the _Prospect_ for a few minutes, and then that died away when Shakes shut it down. A few moments later the _Prospect_'s motors shut down too. They heard Shakes bang out a ringing shave-and-a-haircut with one of his wrenches on the top hatch of the _Gnat_, below the still-closed bottom hatch of the _Prospect_. Then it was quite silent until Hemi came crackling over the ship PA. "OK Chips, open it up."

Chips nodded to Gregory and he reached down into the hatch well and cranked open the sealing wheel. He pulled up the hatch and water steadily flooded up around their boots. Gregory jumped up, as if bitten, and in a matter of seconds was on the other side of the bulkhead, ready to seal the hatch. 

But Chips lay out flat on the grating and reached her hand down into the pool of water. She felt along the welds until she knew where the water was pushing in. "The welds are _mostly_ --- but not totally --- fucking failing. You can see it's leaking," said Chips. "Get the pump hooked up Gregory, and let's get as much of this fuckin' water out of here as fast as fuckin' possible. Then I'll see if I can weld it decent-like."

While Gregory got the hoses for the bilge pump connected, Chips got on the PA with Hemi. "We gotta fix these shitty fuckin' welds or it'll flood the _Gnat_ when we open its hatch, Hemi. Tell Shakes to sit tight, and not to do a fuckin' thing." Hemi acknowledged, and she started putting her welding gear on.

It was cold, frustrating, cramped work. But such had been all of Chips' work on this trip --- maybe her whole life, she reflected. She let out a never-slowing stream of curses, attempting to damn down to a permanent watery hell not just all materials and work processes, but all the societal systems and turns of fate that had conspired to bring her to this particular misery. 

Shakes's welds were horrifically ugly, like stitch work on a revivified cadaver from a Gothic novel. As with the hull of the _Prospect_, she had to hammer metal sheet patches into place, and weld them until they no longer leaked. Chips felt nothing but lucky when the leaking started to slow without her having made the situation worse by cutting through the mating ring or the hull of the _Gnat_.

Eventually enough patching material had been welded into place that the leak slowed to a seep, and then finally stopped altogether. The pump sucked the last of the water out the well, leaving them looking at the domed top hatch of the _Gnat_ down in the recess. The whole mess was holding, though Chips hoped she would never have to test it at any greater depth.

Chips tapped on the hatch with the end of the welding stick. "Eh, Shakes, ya fucker. You can open this fuckin' thing up now," she yelled into the empty metal well, her voice bouncing the curses back at her. There was the sound of the rusty sealing gears squeaking open and the hatch lifted up. 

Shakes was grinning up at them as residual water rained down on him. "Who's a fuckin' angle-fish now, eh?"

"Don't touch them welds when ya come through, the fuckers are still hellish fuckin' hot."

Shakes put his arms up through the hatch hole, found a place to grab that was not still warm from welding, lifted his foot to some protruding knob of steel in the sail of the _Gnat_, and stepped up into the _Prospect_. Gregory pushed the ship intercom button and told Hemi they had Shakes aboard. 

"Right. _Now_ the hard part," said Hemi over the intercom. He got on the ship PA and asked everyone to meet him down at the hatch to the _Gnat_.

[//]: # (### Rigging up power to the Prospect)

"So, basically we are going to suck the life out of the _Gnat_ to keep the _Prospect_ going," Hemi told them when they were all assembled, standing crammed in on both sides of the open hatch to the _Gnat_ below. 

Shakes squirmed. 

"I am going to set up some heavy jumpers between the _Gnat_'s battery banks and the battery rooms of the _Prospect_, where we are standing right now," Hemi continued. "That should be pretty straightforward, and give us access to the _Gnat_'s remaining battery power --- though that will not be much, in terms of the _Prospect_'s power consumption.

"Chips, I need you to do the harder part and figure out how to get the fuel that is left in the _Gnat_ up into the _Prospect_'s engines. I am not sure if it would be better to try to pump it into the _Prospect_'s fuel tanks or run it straight from the _Gnat_'s fuel tanks to the _Prospect_'s diesels."

"Be fuckin' easier to just run a long hose up to the fuckin' _Prospect_'s fuckin' fuel pumps. Won't require fuckin' around with the trim as much," put in Chips.

"If you think that will work, it sounds OK to me," said Hemi. "Sylvia, you want to weigh in with anything?"

"This project is all you, Hem'," said Percy.

"From this moment," Hemi went on, "we need to shut down absolutely everything we are not using. We really should have done this already. We will need every bit of power we can suck out of the _Gnat_ to get across the Authority line into those vaguely friendlier waters. I am even shutting down the lighting, so you will all need to carry a light with you. The good news is, if we get the diesels going, you can take some rotations in the rack, since there will be no power to do anything else but sleep anyway.

"Chips, take Owen and Gregory to work on fuel lines. Bastian, we will go dig up those jumpers. Try to stay out of each other's way everyone," Hemi finished. 

Grabbing Bastian's skinny arm, Hemi led him away to stowage, where he hoped to find the long heavy jumper cables he remembered seeing there sometime in the past year.

Chips took Owen and Gregory off to the engine rooms to get the fuel hoses they normally used for refueling down from their wall racks and rigged to the _Gnat_.

Percy looked down at the mess of patches and foul blackened welds that lined the passageway down through the hole in the bottom of her boat, and for a moment could not believe they were still afloat. "Captain Shakes," she said to the only person left with her, "let me buy you a cup of coffee."

[//]: # (### Rigged up and running)

In a couple of hours, they had a series of umbilicals running through the _Prospect_ and down into the _Gnat_. The big submarine was parasitically sucking the small supply of nutrients the little sub had in reserve: the power was wired into the _Prospect_'s battery hold so that the _Gnat_'s batteries were now no more than an extra battery bank for the _Prospect_ --- conveniently, with a nearly-full charge. And the _Prospect'_ fuel pumps were also engaged and tuned to gently suck the fuel oil up from the _Gnat_'s fuel ballast tanks through the thick fuel lines running between the two boats.

To conserve fuel, they started only one of the _Prospect_'s two diesel engines, along with a single electric motor, driving only one of the _Prospect_'s two propellers. This continually pushed them to one side and they had to compensate with some angle on the rudder, but that was a minor annoyance compared with the task of compensating for the drag of the _Gnat_. Normally they would also be charging the battery banks while running on diesel, but they needed to put all the fuel they had into forward motion. 

The whole setup was a filthy inelegant mess, but they were making headway.

Percy insisted everyone who was not actively doing something should be in the rack. Chips, Shakes, and Hemi did not argue when they were assigned first shift in bed. She had Bastian and Gregory, who were more experienced with the controls of the boat, at the helm seats. They shut down the sonar, since, with the diesel running, they would not be able to hear the approach of any kind of threat until it was too close to do anything anyway.

But as a safety measure, Percy put Owen on radar. It would be just stupid to run into a fleet of Authority surface-enforcement ships for lack of paying attention --- especially considering they did not have the ability to dive or perform any other evasive maneuver. So Owen sat in the dark with his eye on the glowing radar screen, his mind turning to mush as he watched it circle around endlessly, reflecting back nothing.

Percy made everyone in the control room take a pep pill and drink a cup of coffee, which she fixed for them in the dark galley by the light of a penlight.

After a few hours of running like this --- the ship humming and vibrating under them, the hull frame groaning with the stress of dragging along the _Gnat_, and the continual course correction necessitated by running on a single propeller --- Percy was feeling the urge to calculate how far they had managed to travel. At the navigation table, she measured with the calipers and laid down a string of hashes from the x that marked the spot where they had mated the _Gnat_. 

Their process was terrifyingly slow. With the calipers, Percy spun out the remaining distance to the line she had drawn that marked where they would move into the territory of a different --- hopefully safer ---  Authority. She estimated they still had something like eight hours to go. And that was assuming the demarcation line was at all accurate. In addition to just being a rough mark she had laid down from memory, for all she knew, the Authorities might have battled or treatied the line into a totally different part of the ocean. They would not be truly safe until they were docked at the depot. And even then, who knew what the depot folks would be like? Somewhat friendlier to commerce, was about all one could hope for with any confidence.

After six hours listening to the uninterrupted engine-drone in the darkness, Percy made another pot of coffee and brought it down to the crew quarters along with a few tin cups tied together with a small bit of wire. She used her flashlight to hunt her relief crew out of their respective racks and forced coffee into them. Chips strung curses at her, but as red as Chips's eyes were, they were not even close to the bloodshot droop that Percy was swinging around in her own eyeballs.

"Chips, go up and relieve Owen at radar. Hemi, you're with me at the controls." Shakes had pulled the blackout curtain aside and was peering blearily down at them and their coffee from a top rack. "Shakes, you can go back to sleep."

"_Captain_ Shakes. And no fucking way. My boat's on the fucking line here too. I can help y'all drive this fucking conglomeration of scrap."

"I won't insist otherwise. Have a cup of coffee, we'll put you on throttle-rudder. With some luck, we can be at the depot in a few more hours, and maybe still with a few whiffs of fuel left to pump from the _Gnat_. We're gonna owe you something large for this _Captain_ Shakes." 

"Ya know, I'm a friendly fella. And normally I'd say I'm just happy to help, but fuck that," said Shakes, "with y'all sucking the life out of my little boat. A little financial help when we get t' the depot would be genuinely fucking appreciated."

"It's going to be something of a layout for us to get the _Prospect_ repaired, refueled, and fitted up for our next cargo run. We'll do what we can for the _Gnat_, but don't expect a king's ransom or anything. It ain't like you rescued some fuckin' Authority oligarch yacht out there."

"Ya, fuck, I'll keep that in mind next time I'm fuckin' stupid enough to stop and to help folks in need --- only help rich assholes. Lesson learned."

When Percy felt more or less sure they had finally passed over where the Authority Control line might vaguely be, she climbed up to the bridge of the sail. Up in the light breeze, she scanned around the horizon with a pair of binoculars. She saw some aircraft off in the distance, but they were not coming towards the _Prospect_. She felt like the _Prospect_ must surely be in the new Authority's waters now. But there was no way to tell with any certainty.

They cruised easily on the surface with the diesel running for the next few hours. Hemi repeatedly made the trek down through the _Prospect_ and into the _Gnat_ to check the remaining fuel oil. Each time he diligently pulled the dipstick and, gripping it with an oily rag, noted the fuel level remaining by the light of his flashlight. 

On one of these trips through the boat he found Chips asleep in her rack and woke her up. "Chips, I need you to tune that engine to absolutely maximize efficient fuel consumption," he told her. She groggily got on her feet and marked the passage of the next several hours by keeping up a steady beat of oaths from deep in the ship while she carefully and continually trimmed the diesel engine's fuel intake.

No matter how parsimonious they were with the power usage and fuel consumption though, the _Prospect_ was so much bigger that it was eating through the _Gnat_'s remaining fuel oil at an insatiable rate. Back in the control room of the _Prospect_, Hemi calculated how quickly they were burning fuel oil by hand, and measured it against how far they had to go. He could not promise Percy that they would not be rowing the _Prospect_ the last few miles.

Hemi, Shakes, and Percy were exhaustedly staring at the wall of gauges in front of them. Most of the gauges remained completely static, and the fuel gauge simply read empty, since it could not reflect the fuel they were sucking up from the _Gnat_. Other than Hemi's occasional forays down to the _Gnat_ to check the hard numbers, they were simply going on the hope that they had enough fuel to make it to the depot and not get left stranded once again over a deserted --- and very deep --- part of the ocean.

Hemi finally broke the bleary, hazy silence. "Something bothers me, Sylvia."

"We've been scraping our way on our bellies under the razor-wire fencing of hell's fucking perimeter for days, and _now_ something bothers you Hemi?"

"I think that is part of it --- we have been so on the edge of our capabilities that I have not had a chance to step back and consider things."

"Well, what the fuck is it that's eatin' ya, my man-mountain?"

"The sub with the ram. It is such an unusual weapon for a modern submarine. Are you sure about it?

"Abso-fucking-certain. Lotta subs look the same, and that ram is something else under the sun. Some kinda custom job, without the sleek, expensive quality of gear ya see on military machines usually. Looks like it was worked up as some ancient siege engine, for storming a stone fortress or something. And then some crazy motherfucker bought it as scrap and welded the whole fucking heavy water-dragging thing onto the front of their submarine."

Hemi nodded. "Then my primary question is: why did they ram _us_? I have no recollection that we ever had an interaction with such a distinctive boat before."

"I had the same question," said Shakes, "but I didn't want to put my fucking nose into your business, just as I wouldn't want you askin' about mine. But since yer asking Hemi..."

"It does seem odd. We're just a cargo sub," Percy said, looking steadily at Shakes. "Of course, we're always being harassed by various Authorities in general-like ways --- that's just part of the business. But usually it's more of an ask-questions-first kind of interaction. And we're fuckin' small potatoes by any measure you care to put to it. They have wars to fight and borders to defend up there. They spend their concentrated long-term resources on their never-ending fucking conflicts with each other. Harassing commerce too much is bad for, well, business."

"And we are the commerce," Shakes said.

"Even if that sub with the ram was trying to hit us particularly," continued Percy, "seems most likely they won't follow us across fuckin' Authority lines, and we won't be seeing them again. We'll just avoid coming back this way any time soon."

"Leaves ya with a big fuckin' mystery as to _why_ though, don't ya think?" asked Shakes.

"Indeed," said Hemi, "though sometimes the pragmatic course of action is to leave the questions aside and move in a different direction."

The silence settled back in on them. Percy pulled one of the few remaining cigarillos from the pack stashed against the wall and lit it. She puffed away steadily until she had filled up the small space of the control room with smoke. Hemi slid back down to the navigation chart with his flashlight, and a few minutes later called up to Percy. "Sylvia, by my calculations you should be able to see the depot island from the bridge now."
