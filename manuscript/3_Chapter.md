"About fuckin' time," said Percy. She planned to climb up to the bridge for the view, but first she wanted to look through the periscope. Since it would be higher up above the surface, she would potentially be able to see farther. The bearing was obviously straight ahead, so she swung the barrel of the periscope around while looking through the viewfinder. The cigarillo still hung from her lips, with smoke rising to her nostrils. "Aye. Fuckin' dawn's cracking...and I see a blot of an island ahead of us." She watched it for a while. Details slowly came into focus. It was a rocky, slightly-cliffed shore with some sparse vegetation on top.

"Mind if I look?" Shakes asked.

"Help yourself." Percy stepped back and pulled the cigarillo from her lips as she exhaled.

Shakes squinted into the viewfinder. "Um...Cap'n Percy...there's nothing on that fuckin' island."

"No. The depot is for, ya know, discreet fuckin' operations. It's entirely underwater, built into the side of the seamount."

"Ah," said Shakes, tapping the side of his greasy nose knowingly. 

It was fairly common for a depot that handled sensitive cargo to be built partly underwater --- particularly the submarine docking area. That kept Authority eyes off comings and goings. But usually there was also a small surface component for handling completely licensed and permitted cargo, and for the convenience of being able to operate without the complexity and care underwater fittings required when it was possible to do so. But with a depot located close to the border between two aggressive Authorities, there was a clear logic to keeping the whole operation off the surface.

"So, how the fuck do we..." Shakes started to ask.

The ship-to-ship radio lit up over their heads. *"To approaching submarine: stop your motors and prepare to be boarded."*

"That's how," said Percy.

They shut the _Prospect_'s motor down, and Percy headed up to the bridge on the top of the sail. A mini-sub, maybe fifteen meters long, had surfaced off their starboard side. A pair of large men, almost as big as Hemi, were climbing into an inflatable boat. They motored across the gap between the two subs and climbed up the steel rungs on the outside of the _Prospect_'s sail.

"Transport sub?" was the first question as soon as they stood on the bridge. They wore old moth-eaten wool clothes, like fishermen: tightly worsted slacks and cable-knit sweaters.

"Yes," said Percy. "We're unarmed: no tubes."

"Right," said the one of the two who had not spoken yet and spat on her deck. "We just gotta do a quick check if ya want to come any closer to the fuckin' island. Otherwise, ya gotta go back the way ya came."

"Well, we got no fuel left, so we're not going back anywhere. Get your check over with."

They climbed down the hatch. They spent the next twenty minutes crawling through the _Prospect_ with Shakes and Hemi. When they got back to the control room, they were a little less gruff. "Eh, fuck. Sorry, but being fucking careful in these waters is how we stay in fucking business. Y'all seem harmless enough, though it's fucking curious comin' in hauling another sub under ya."

"Not exactly my original plan," said Percy. "So what's the docking procedure here?"

"Well, first fucking step is the dock fee. You pay that to us before you dock."

Percy suddenly regretted her comment that they were out of fuel. She had accidentally given them a lever to extract whatever they wanted from her for this "docking fee." And extract they did. Based on her experience, she estimated that probably fifteen percent of the price they quoted her was legitimate. The rest they would pocket. She asked them to wait while she retrieved a stack of coins from her cabin.

They split the coins between them, barely even pretending that it was a legitimate transaction. With the coins stashed in their pockets, the depot men became quite friendly. "OK, boss. You can get on your ship-to-ship and contact the docking control office. They'll give you a dock assignment and turn the sonar beacon on for ya. If there's anything else we can help you with, you can ring us up on ship-to-ship as well."

"Thanks so fuckin' much," said Percy.

She followed them as they climbed back outside on the bridge. They puttered their little inflatable boat back to their small patrol sub. Percy could see them sharing a laugh between themselves even from the height of the _Prospect_'s sail.

[//]: # (### They dock at the underwater dock)

Back in the control room, Percy picked up the ship-to-ship mic and raised the docking control office. She got their assigned docking port and, sealing up the _Prospect_'s external hatch, they used the last remaining few minutes of their batteries to dive the boat. 

It occurred to Shakes that diving the _Prospect_ to dock would push the _Gnat_ beyond his rough estimate of a depth limit --- deeper than it had ever been. For this reason, he decided to ride out the docking procedure down in his boat. If he heard sounds that indicated the hull might fail, he could warn Percy to surface. From the control chair of the _Gnat_, he could also watch the approaching depot docking bay through the viewport.

The docking bay was located about twenty meters underwater. It was typical of an underwater docking bay for cargo --- a long cylindrical tube of curved and welded plate steel. It stuck a hundred meters out of the side of the seamount and was supported by hazardous and seemingly randomly-placed steel bracing beams that ran from the tube back to the seamount at an angle. There were docking slips of a wide variety of sizes placed on all four sides of the tube along the entire length of it, capable of docking all manner of sizes and orientations of cargo subs. They numbered between a dozen and two dozen, and maybe half of them had submarines docked at them already, arranged at an array of angles. They looked like leeches with their orifices sucking at a giant limb.

The _Prospect_ followed the sonar beacon to docking slip four, located on the bottom of the docking bay tube. It was the largest size slip this depot had available --- or even widely used in the cargo sub industry. A semi-standard size for large cargo hold hatches. They carefully eased the _Prospect_ under slip four, until the big cargo hatch on the _Prospect_'s deck came up to the docking slip and connected to it --- essentially a scaled-up maneuver of exactly how the _Gnat_ had mated to the underside of the _Prospect_.

Hemi went down to the cargo hold and walked, hunched over, across the catwalk that hung two meters down from the ceiling. Percy could walk fully upright on the catwalk, but not Hemi. He made his way to the large cargo hatch above the far end of the catwalk. There, he picked up a rubber mallet that was left hanging on some hooks for this purpose and banged on the big cargo hatch with it, setting off a pleasant low gonging sound that reverberated for a full twenty seconds. He waited a few seconds more and then heard the pop of the dock crew unsealing the hatch into the docking bay above him, the whir of an electric pump sucking the residual water out of the slip well, and then a few minutes after that came the answering pounding on the _Prospect_'s cargo hatch letting Hemi know it was OK to pop it. He released the hatch locks.

Two winches were set on either side of the cargo hatch along the catwalk. The big hatch was closed by two concave half-moon doors that lay one over the other to form a low dome. The upper one needed to be raised first. Hemi grabbed the wheel that turned the winch and put a good portion of his straining and powerful muscle into it, but it would not budge. This sometimes happened when the air pressure between a sub and a dock was not equalized. Hemi was trying to push up the door when there was slightly more than an atmosphere of pressure weighing on it.

[//]: # (I do not _totally_ have a grip on the physics here. I believe that because a sub maintains its own atmosphere at what should more or less be the same pressure while on the surface the atmospheric pressure is constantly changing, it seems like the differential when opening a sub that was sealed could go either way. In _Das Boot_ he mentions a number of times the hatches popping open like corks when they surface and release the locks. But I do not recall him talking about the pressure going the other way. I am just going to assume that it can go either way though. In this case, the depot is open to the surface above, at one atmosphere of pressure, but the Prospect is submerged. Seems like there should be some differential at least. And since it is under, I am just going to go with it being the surface atmosphere that is higher.)

He picked up a breaker bar that hung next to the rubber mallet and set it over a fat pin of steel welded to the column of the winch wheel. With the extra meter or so of leverage, he easily turned the winch wheel a few degrees and there was an audible pop and hiss as the extra pressure of the air in the depot pushed through the slit in the cargo hatch and into the _Prospect_. Hemi pinched his nose and cleared his ears with a pop that sounded like a small version of the sound of the hatch opening.

Once the seal was broken, he stowed the breaker bar and easily, but somewhat slowly, due to the gearing, winched open one cargo hatch door and then the other. When the doors were fully opened, he extended a steel ladder --- its pawls clanking on the locking teeth --- up into the docking bay so a person could climb up and down from the _Prospect_.

[//]: # (### Description of the docking bay)

Hemi climbed up the ladder and was greeted by two more men who Hemi would have sworn were clones of the men who came out to inspect the _Prospect_ before they docked. The same enormous bulk, the same worn wool clothes, the same gruff look. The two men lit up cigarettes and spat bits of stray black tobacco out on the deck while they waited for Hemi to come up the ladder.

These guys did give Hemi a rough handshake when he stepped off the ladder, but offered little more in the way of welcome. Hemi managed to get some monosyllabic directions from them to the dock boss, and the impression that she would be able to set them up with repairs, refueling, and any other boat maintenance needs. Hemi thanked them, gave them a little money for their trouble, and with money in hand they quickly wandered off without any further pomp.

Hemi lowered himself a few steps back down the ladder until he was enough inside the _Prospect_ to use the intercom to raise Percy. He gave her his impressions of the docking bay and told her they needed to talk to the dock boss.

"Stay there, Hemi. I'll be there in a few minutes with Shakes," Percy responded over the intercom.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

The two of them appeared a quarter of an hour later. Percy was carrying a beaten and cracked leather folio in which she kept the ship's books. Shakes was empty-handed, but had apparently freshly greased and pointed his hair for the big outing on the depot dock.

Hemi had been waiting on the deck of the docking bay. He gave Percy and Shakes a hand up the ladder. When they were all assembled, they started off toward the far end of the docking bay, where they could see a wooden sign hanging from the ceiling, painted white, with square hand-painted black letters that said "Dock Office." 

Actually getting to the dock office was a matter of navigating around the open holes in the deck that led down into the cargo holds of other docked subs. There were other obstacles too, like the ladders hanging down from the subs docked above, or stacks of crates waiting to be loaded into subs docked on either side. Where no submarines were docked, the space was used as staging areas for cargo that was making its way down the docking bay in steps toward whatever sub it was destined to be loaded onto, or otherwise up the dock from where it had been unloaded. 

They made slow progress, since they had to watch every step and stop to wait for workers who were in the process of moving cargo. The docking bay was bigger than any space on a submarine --- maybe twelve to fifteen meters in circumference --- but still cramped and grimed.

[//]: # (### The dock office and the dock boss)

The dock office was simply a partition made of cheap painted wood built in front of the unused first docking slip. It was brightly lit. Both sides were lined with metal chairs on which were stacked folders and binders of paper. The center of the office was mostly taken up by a large steel desk with a chipped and rusted enameled surface. It too was covered with papers: loose, stacked, on clipboards, and in binders.

Behind the desk sat yet another huge person, also dressed in heavy wool garments that had been aerated by moth larva. Hemi would not have tried to guess, being the parsimonious fellow he was, but the men who had met him on the dock had referred to the dock boss as "she." She tipped back her cap when they entered the office and held a clipboard out at arm's length, trying to get a better focus on what was written on it.

"You must be from the boat that just came in on slip four, eh?" she asked.

"That's right. I'm Captain Percy. She's my boat --- the _Prospect_." 

The dock boss squinted up at her.

"Actually, there's two boats," said Shakes.

"Ah, hmm," said the dock boss. "There's a note here that you have a mini sub mated on the bottom of the big boat. That's a pretty unusual docking arrangement."

[//]: # (I am pretty sure I included this ah hmm here as a too-subtle nod to Gaddis. I remember him using that construction a number of times in his books, and thinking: who ever says that? Meanwhile people writing about Gaddis are always saying he captures language so well. Much as I love Gaddis, I always thought his dialog kinda missed in the actual way people speak department.)

"We would not normally come in that way," said Hemi, "but we are in pretty bad shape. We had to rig up a whole complicated situation with the smaller sub to have enough power to get here. We have basically got no power, no fuel, and we need repairs and restock."

"Hmph. Well. We're full-service here. This island is pretty isolated, so we keep a lot of stock and parts on hand. Having a deep supply is the good side of being isolated. The bad side is that shit's going to be pretty fucking expensive. It costs a premium to move it out here. I give folks honest assessments --- hell, that's how I got this shitty dock boss position --- but most of the goods around here are sold from the crew of one independent operator to another. I can't control what prices those connivers might try to get from those who might be a little desperate."

"Can you point us in the right direction for purchasing supplies and hiring some halfway decent welders who can do repairs?" Percy asked.

"There's a market and exchange floor further up the tunnel where you can get parts and supplies. And I'll give ya a list of contacts up and down the dock who should be able to set you up with fuel and repairs and the like. I'll try to give you the least-worst of that bunch of bone-scraping, marrow-sucking dickheads." She started scribbling down a list of names and associated slips on the back of a used envelope.

"OK, repairs are my first priority," said Percy, "but I have a few other points of business to take care of while I'm here. I'm looking for a woman called 'Miss Mai.'"

"Oh sure, everyone on the island knows Miss Mai. You can find her office on the exchange level. I'll let her know you are coming."

"Thanks."

"What about Authorities? Is there significant activity from them around here?" Hemi asked.

"Mostly they leave us alone. As I say, this is one of the only places you can move goods for cash in this part of the drink, so we ended up a small but critical operation. The Authorities on one side want their people to be able to trade goods, and the Authorities on the other side want that too --- even if they would never admit it, and endlessly skirmish over where exactly the fucking line lies. It's a good, quiet operation here, far from the fucking noise and crush of all the meaningless action and events that seem so important to those folks trying to carve up pieces of the surface to control. It's pleasantly remote here, it is. While it fucking lasts, anyway."

"Sounds like a nice place to retire," said Shakes. "No sun, no wind, nothing to keep you from happily living out your days in a dank grimy hole."

"Anyway..." Percy interrupted, "thanks for the orientation. Hemi can you get that list of contacts for repairs and refueling? Shakes, you probably want to go with him and make sure you get the _Gnat_ fueled back up?"

Shakes nodded. 

With a list of contacts from the deck boss and a few more passing words of thanks, they cleared out. Hemi and Shakes returned down the docking bay to start talking to vendors about refueling and repairs. Percy went the other way, up off the docking bay.

[//]: # (### Percy walks up the exchange floor: description)

The welded steel plating of the docking bay tube extended ten meters or so beyond the dock office and marked the end of the docking bay, where it was set into the sea mount. Just beyond the dock office the tube angled upwards, and Percy had to walk up a steep ramp. Then the tube narrowed to five or six meters and passed through a thick bulkhead with a large watertight door that could be closed by massive hydraulics. Most unpressurized underwater docks had some kind of system like this. Small leaks on the docks could be repaired while pumps moved the water out. But if something major happened --- say, a docked submarine ripping away, leaving a giant hole in the dock --- this door could be closed, divers could go in and make repairs, and they could then blow the water out of the dock with a high pressure air system. Of course, that would not save anyone trapped on the other side of the door when it closed, or keep any open cargo holds in docked subs from flooding. These underwater docks were in fact incredibly dangerous, and the stories of failures --- more numerous than anyone would care to admit --- were the stuff of submariners' nightmares. The repressed fear of a dock failure was an odd sense for a seagoing person like Percy, since traditionally ports were associated with safety for ships.

A little farther up the ramp from the watertight bulkhead, the steel plating ended where it was riveted and sealed into the raw rock of the seamount. The space widened here. This whole part of the depot was hollowed out of the underground stone and the walls were left as raw, cut rock. In places, the lines of drill holes could still be seen, where explosives had been placed to more quickly open spaces for the chamber during its construction. This was all pretty unusual and expensive. Most depots with an underwater dock kept the underground construction to a minimum and moved as much of the operation to the surface as was practical. Percy guessed there must be the discreet funding of some Authority behind this place.

The upward slope became less dramatic, just a slight ramp. But the ramp was maintained for an obvious reason: few underground spaces were totally dry and this one was not an exception. The ramp slowly drained a fetid and oily moisture down the middle of the open space of the upper parts of the depot. And the water carried along with it the accumulated grime of a working floor of industrial and commercial projects: metal shavings, coffee grounds, oils and solvents, random bits of floating garbage, and, of course, urine. It was all collected at the bottom of the ramp in a sluiceway covered by a choked and rusting grating that was supposed to keep any of this stuff from running farther down to the docking bay.

The wet grit ground under the hard soles of Percy's boots as she made her way up the length of the merchant exchange floor, stepping around the places where oil or garbage had pooled on the uneven rock.

The main hall was lit by bright bars of harsh light overhead, which illuminated the middle of the space fairly well. The center of the entire length of the hall was being used for the activities that required the most space: stacks of wooden crates containing cargo that was being actively exchanged, repairs on large metal machines that were in some places slung from the ceiling by heavy chain, and the parked heavy equipment used to move all this tonnage up and down the space. 

The lighting did not do much to illuminate the deeper sides of the space. Back in those corners were shadows created by smaller stacks of crates, punctuated by the occasional table set up by a trader and lit by a lamp. In some places there were alcoves carved back into the rock for a more formal shop space.

There was a loud wash of sound: the snap of arc welders liquefying bits of metal, traders negotiating the value of crates and where they would be moved from or to, and the clinking of chains as they strained on wheels to lift masses of weighty metal objects. There was also the inevitable unintelligible shout of panic as some heavy object unexpectedly moved in a way it was not supposed to. Her nostrils were assaulted by the smells of sweat, tobacco smoke, oil, and sharp ozone.

About a third of the way up the hall, her eye was caught by one of the bigger shops cut back into the wall. It was better lit than most, and the proprietor had taken the trouble to pry open a number of the crates stacked in the shop and arrange some of the more attractive goods to tempt potential customers.

[//]: # (### In the hardware store; Percy meets Miss Mai)

Percy turned into the shop. It sold hardware. A wide array of tools and parts lay in a semi-organized fashion among the hay and batting used as packing material in the crates. Some of the packing material had inevitably escaped the crates and was crushed into the grime on the floor. 

Larger items were displayed towards the front of the store, probably because they were harder to steal. The crates at the front of the shop were left open at the top, and looking down into them she could see large motors, piping, valves, and other bigger elements that went into making a submarine work. 

Toward the back of the shop, the crates tended to be laid on their side and opened. Many of the crates had dozens of hooks nailed into them and smaller tools and parts for sale hung from the hooks. 

The shopkeeper somehow managed to show little interest in the few customers poking around in the crates, and yet never stopped watching them.

Percy had a perennial list of hardware she needed for the _Prospect_. It was one of those lists that only ever seemed to grow, and rarely got things crossed off it. She almost immediately found a box with a range of sizes of screw-tightened clamps that were being sold as a single unit. Clamps were not currently on her hardware list, so she regrettably would not get to cross anything off. On the other hand, she would already have the clamps aboard the _Prospect_ when they needed them, rather than going onto the "to" list and waiting to be purchased on at the next stop.

Percy picked up the box of clamps and moved to browse some of the larger parts. In one open crate there was a beautiful pump motor, in factory-new condition, a rarity these days when most machines --- even excellent ones --- had been rebuilt a dozen times over. It was the kind of motor used in dozens of places and applications on the _Prospect_. It was another item that was not actually on her list of needed parts, but potentially so useful that she could not imagine not buying it. In this condition, however, it would not be cheap.

She leaned over the crate and ran her fingers under the cover to check for hidden grit and make sure it was actually factory-new, and not just well-cleaned old junk. As she did so, an old crone who had been looking at a box of steel piping near her leaned in her direction to admire the pump motor too. "That's a fine-looking piece of machine," the lady said, her voice croaking so softly it took Percy a second to interpret what she had said.

"I have a boat where I could use ten more of these," Percy replied.

"Pretty expensive element for buying multiples of." The lady was frail and small. In this depot full of huge people, she was certainly the tiniest Percy had seen, or would even expect to see. She had big rubbery ears and a heavily lined face with a tiny nose that wiggled when she talked. She was dressed in a wool cloak that was worn thin but clearly made of what was originally a high-quality material. Over it, she wore a fraying shawl with an intricate Fair Isle pattern. She looked like a person who would never be quite warm enough in this hole-in-the-rock depot.

"The cost is the reason I'll be lucky to get a single one of these," said Percy.

"Hrmmm....what if I told you I could set you up with a little cash?"

Percy looked at the tiny stick-figure-in-a-sack skeptically. "Like a loan?" she asked. Loan sharks certainly came in all shapes and sizes.

"No, no. I don't go in for usury. That's for the real criminals. I'm offering a job. But one that would pay exceptionally well."

"Well, that's certainly a fucking unlikely coincidence that you happen to offer me work when I was just about to go inquiring about a job."

"That is, of course, no coincidence, Captain Percy. I was looking for you."

"Then you must be Miss Mai? But how did you know who I was?"

"I received a note that you had arrived. I came out to the hall to try to locate you. There is an element of urgency to the job I have for you."

Percy remembered the dock boss had said she would send word ahead to Miss Mai. "Thanks for the transparency. I don't like the suggestion of a benign universe that coincidences like that would suggest."

"Ah, yes. It's easier to believe the plot and the happenings are motivated by someone's will, eh? That it isn't all just random chaos, and the coin-toss sometimes comes up in your favor?"

"Oh, I believe in the chaos," said Percy, "I just don't believe it comes up in my fucking favor."

Miss Mai grinned a gapped-toothed smile. "I think I can work with such a person. Can I encourage you to join me in my office to discuss the details of the offer I have for you? It's...not really fit for public spaces."

"Miss Mai, nothing would please me more than to learn about this fucking opportunity." Percy put down the box of clamps and noticed that the shopkeeper watched her do so.

[//]: # (### Negotiation with Miss Mai for the explosives shipping job)

In the open space of the hall, Miss Mai hobbled next to Percy.  Percy took her arm to help her along. It was a thin little stick of bone in Percy's strong hand.

"So, the dock boss told you all about me already?" Percy asked, hoping to assess the levelness of the playing field.

"The dock boss, yes, and a few others... My friend Turnaround Bob told me you are eminently trustworthy and reliable. And also run a big enough boat for the particular job I need done."

"Yeah, Bob tracked me down on the mainland and suggested I head out to this shithole depot to look for you. He hinted the work might be...profitable."

"My dear Captain Percy, would you mind toning down your colorful language a bit during our interactions?"

"I'm a fucking sailor. What do you expect?"

[//]: # (Why is there so much gratuitous cursing in this story? Your answer is above!)

Miss Mai shuffled on silently --- and, Percy thought, somewhat reproachfully --- for a minute. "Anyway. In my line of work, it is best to know a little something about those you hire. Though again, in the interest of transparency, all I really know is your name and that you have a boat."

"What's with all the transparency?" Percy asked.

"Ah, yes. Typically I play my cards a bit closer. But as I said, this job is of some urgency, so I am hoping to build some trust with you quickly. I can only hope you respond reciprocally."

"Well then, in the interest of transparency you should know that my boat, as solid as she is, is currently in desperate need of some downtime for repairs. There's a limited amount of urgency we can put into picking up a job."

"With the amount I'll be offering you, I think you will be able to make the shortest possible downtime a priority."

"In that case I just hope we have similar ideas about what it costs to have priorities."

Miss Mai nodded knowingly. "Here we are." She steered Percy towards a low creosoted wooden door set into the wall of the main hall. Inside, Miss Mai's office had the same bare rock walls as all the other depot spaces, but was more warmly lit from sconces along the walls. Many ancient wooden filing cabinets leaned against each other for support under the sconces, and contributed their woody exteriors to the effort to soften the feel of the place. In the center, a few large, heavily stuffed leather chairs sat across from each other; a small table stuck between them appeared to be constructed of some exotic wood.

"I can offer you tea or coffee, Captain Percy."

"Coffee, please. A good amount of sugar."

"Cream?"

"Sure, I'll take a little creamer."

"Not creamer, Captain Percy, cream."

"Holy fuck --- pardon my language --- you have cream? Real, liquid cream?"

"It's extremely expensive but, as with most things, it can be had here for the right price. I am happy to share a few drops with a business prospect."

"By all means, then."

Percy sat in one of the leather chairs and accepted a ceramic cup with mud-colored contents with one hand. With the other hand she received the metal clipboard with chipping black paint and oil-stained pages that Miss Mai was holding out to her.  She scanned it while taking her first sip of coffee. 

It was the best coffee Percy had had in months. 

Miss Mai lowered herself with a soft groan into the chair opposite Percy.

"So you want us to transport magnetic mines?" Percy asked.

"Please," said Miss Mai, "the shipping of mines is extremely restricted and mostly illegal. These are magnetically-activated industrial explosives."

"...For which the primary use would be mines, and thus still illegal to ship."

"The units are absolutely agnostic in their uses. They don't have to be for a mine: could be a torpedo, missile, suicide-bomber, sling-shot, whatever. The oceans teem with rusting hulks of ferrous metal, grinding their way back and forth atop --- and under, of course --- the surface of the sea; leaving their foul trails of oil, carbon, and noise. There is quite a bit of demand for units that can help clean up the mess."

"Is that why you need me? You can't get an Authority seal to ship these because they are going to a group that's trying to 'clean up' the oceans?"

"You know as well as I do that the seal of one Authority just aggravates the aggression of another, regardless of where, or whom, your items are being shipped to." She sighed. "Unfortunately, these days, conventional shipping ends up being an unwinnable game of tic-tac-toe with a high chance that no matter how well stamped, sealed, and authorized a shipment like this might be, it will simply never arrive at its destination due to interference from another antagonist. The most reliable way is to use a specialty shipping services unit like yours, with your professional expertise at clandestine maneuvering and your discreet interests. It's simply a matter of reliability, you know. Nothing more."

"Certainly if we were any less reliable, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you right now."

"There's also the matter of speed. I really need to get these units out of this depot in the next couple of days. I'd rather not say why, so do not ask. But I believe it will benefit us both if you do as I suggested earlier and make the repairs to your boat as quickly as possible, and move on with this cargo."

"Well, that brings us to the price. To make the repairs a priority is not going to be cheap, especially from what I hear about the workers available on the dock."

"Captain Percy, in this particular case, money is a secondary consideration. Name your price."

Percy hesitated. "How about... three times a standard hull-load fee?"

[//]: # (A hull load = the amount one average-sized cargo submarine could carry. It's an established norm, even though some small subs could only carry half a hull load, and bigger ones 1.5 hull loads on a run. The _Prospect_ carries a pretty typical hull load.)

"Done. I can pay you two-thirds now and the remainder on delivery. I assume coin will be satisfactory?"

"Entirely satisfactory," said Percy, regretting that she had not asked for more. Still, she had never been paid triple a hull load before.

Miss Mai stood and shuffled over to a sideboard where an enormous ledger book was laid out open. She made marks with a large fountain pen in it between counting out heavy coins and placing them into a soft leather satchel. While watching Miss Mai pick apart the coins, Percy noticed for the first time that she only had three fingers on her right hand.

Miss Mai continued the conversation while counting as if it were no effort. "This must be quite a bit of money for you, Captain Percy. Tell me, have you thought about selling your boat after you make the delivery and taking all the profit you will have and settling down with a nice man somewhere?"

Percy smiled at this matronly side of Miss Mai. "Well, you know what the old clich√© says about captains: I'm married to my boat. There's no man who could compete with her. Besides, you also know how the surface life is: where it isn't chaos, it's bureaucracy. I'd rather stay underwater."

Miss Mai nodded. "Unfortunately, there is some truth to that. There's no sure future anywhere on the surface. Makes it hard to commit to settling down anywhere particular."

"Not to change the subject Miss Mai, but how likely is it that we're going to have some kind of Authority interference while trying to move this shipment of yours?"

"You know how the Authorities are Captain Percy. In some places they pursue everything. An honest logistician cannot ever promise there won't be interference. That's why we move things by submarine: interference is a lot less likely if they don't know the shipping is happening. In this case, I would suggest that you do your absolute best to make sure no Authority finds out this particular shipment is happening."

Percy ran her fingers through her cropped hair. "Let me ask you about another thing: Do you know anything about some Authority sub with a big ugly ram mounted on the front of it? Damned thing just about split the _Prospect_ in half on the way here. It's the reason we came limping in, and why we need the major repair work."

At the mention of the ram Miss Mai's eyebrows went up with a look of concern. "A ram on a submarine, you say?"

Percy nodded.

"The only time I've heard of such a thing --- at least within the current century --- is on a boat called the _Grackle_, An Authority enforcer out of the Northern Points."

"What would it be doing a thousand miles from its home waters?"

"That I do not know the answer to. Except, I'll tell you this Captain Percy: I hear rumors of new governing structures. Things being tried that might eventually weaken the local fiefdoms and establish new flows of global order. One such experiment is a suggestion I've heard recently that certain Authorities are now granting privateers warrants that promise a bounty on captured or sunk merchant shipping operating under the aegis of certain other Authorities --- regardless of where that shipping is."

"That seems likely to start a few wars."

"It would. Except the rumors are that some of the most powerful Authorities are mobilizing against much weaker Authorities. It's possible that rather than a protracted war, what we may end up with is a congealing of global power in the hands of a few Authorities. At least as far as shipping and trade are concerned."

"And you're saying the sub with the ram, this _Grackle_, might have got itself one of these privateer warrants?"

"It is one possibility that would explain where and why you encountered it."

"But why the _Prospect_?"

"That's what concerns me the most. Turnaround Bob works quickly and means well, but his business networks leak worse than that docking bay down there. There's a chance that the job you are about to take on is already marked by some Authority as a valid concern for privateers. You may already be a target."

Percy looked into her nearly empty coffee cup, and then savored the last sip of its creamy sweetness. "Well, I guess you get what you're paid for." She stood. "Thanks for the coffee with cream." 

"You are most welcome. I'll have my men down on the dock by the end of today with the cargo, if you think you could be ready to load your boat by then."

"Thanks." Percy turned to go.

"Captain Percy, if I were you I would definitely make sure you are gone from here before the next 48 hours goes by."

Percy nodded toward Miss Mai and closed the heavy door behind as she left the office.

[//]: # (### To the bar; hiring Cassandra)

She hummed to herself as she walked through the main hall of the noisy depot. She realized that her humming was resonating in her skull in harmony with the ever-present background buzz of the machinery that kept the place functioning. 

She followed the trickle of oily water down the slope a little way until she noticed a kind of canteen or saloon carved back into one of the walls. She walked in and stepped up to a bar at nearly the height of her chest. It was broad and made of dark wood from which decades of drinkers had worn away the original shellac coating. A universe of spilled drinks had stained it to a mottled gray color. As in all the remote places of the world, the bar was well stocked. Rows and rows of partially empty bottles of brown liquors were lined up behind it.

The man behind the bar was yet another giant, but only in the vertical direction. Rail thin, somewhat like Bastian, except for a paunch around the belly. Years ago, Percy had had a friend who would have described him as 'a skinny, fat guy.' He was grizzled about the face, like a piece of meat that had not been cleaned properly before being laid down in the frying pan. He was missing an eye which he did not bother to cover with a patch and wearing a stained leather apron. "Whatcha need there, lady?" he asked Percy.

[//]: # (Vickers Gringo -- Paul Daniel Lyon, 1978-2010 -- was the one who said he would someday be a skinny fat guy. One small detail of the dude, that maybe I am the only person who remembers. So I put it in here.)

"Give me something brown from that middle row there." She took one of her new coins from the heavy leather satchel Miss Mai had given her and laid it down on the wood of the bar. 

As the bartender set up a glass and leaned to pour it, Percy continued the conversation, despite the fact that the bartender did not particularly look like he would want to. "Actually, I'm looking to hire some crew. I have a boat, and we're short a few people. Thought you might be able to steer me in the right direction to where the hiring is done around here."

"Most of the steering I do is towards the bottles," said the bartender. "You want crew, you're better off down on the dock. Usually there's some fuckin' greenies hanging around, going boat to boat and just askin' for work even. Useless fuckers, skills wise, but always seem to be present." He thought for a few seconds while he finished off the pour. "On the second hand, a lot of big boats have come through in the last week or so. It's possible they've hired up all the greenies. _Big_ fuckin' boats. Two hundred meters and more."

"Yeah, that kind of boat is always hiring. Shit, that doesn't sound good. I'm a little desperate."

The bartender squinted up the side of his face where his eye would have been considering for a few seconds. "Hrmm. Well, if yer fuckin' desperate...bartendin' is my side-gig. My main business, and much more profitable I might add, is pimpin'."

"You don't fuckin' say."

"Thing about pimpin' in a place like this is sometimes you gotta take risks on the folks ya bring over from the mainland to work. Beggars can't be choosers, ya might say. So once in a while I end up with whores I can't pimp out. Or at least not at a price that makes them worth the food they eat."

"Always difficult to balance those books, I hear ya," said Percy.

"Anyway, right now I got me this chickilette that got off a boat a few weeks ago. But she's skinny and small. Waif-like, I say. You know what I mean?"

Percy nodded.

"The tastes of most of the folks who come through here are into something a bit...harder. Here's the big thing, though: she's got just the saddest fuckin' face. And she's too shy. Even I can't bring meself to bein' comfortable-like pimping her out. A pimp has got to have a heart, you know."

"So you're saying you'll let me hire her off you because she makes you too fucking sad?"

The bartender shrugged. "Plus a finders-fee, like," he said, and Percy knew she had made another negotiating mistake in letting the bartender see the heavy satchel full of coins she was carrying.

"Thing is, I need a sonar operator. I don't care if she's tiny, but do you think she has good ears?"

He shrugged again. "Well, I'll tell you this: those whores of mine have a record player in their quarters. Drives me fucking crazy, but when I tried to dispose of it I had a large-scale fuckin' whore-revolt on my hands. That little waif in particular, I noticed, listens to the fuckin' records all the time. Does that suggest anything about her ears?"

"Might mean she's deaf already." She sipped her drink. "Fuck it. It's not like I'm going into battle. If she's not completely deaf, we can have her sit sonar watch during long runs. She won't be entirely useless."

"Swell," said the bartender. "I need that depressing little shade out of my life." He called down the bar to where a small group of girls were drinking from a row of shot glasses that a couple of men had purchased for them. "Cassandra! Come over here. I have someone I want you to meet."

A short girl with stick arms and huge eyes walked towards them. She was wearing a slip of a blue dress made of worn cotton. She had sharp fingernails, brightly painted but chipped in places.

As she got closer the bartender said, "This lady might want to hire you." And turned away to deal with some other customers.

"Fuck," said Percy, "can you see in the dark with those eyes, girl?"

[//]: # (The convention in a sub story is the sonar operator has amazing ears, potentially signaled by having huge ears. Cassandra has giant eyes instead.)

"I don't know," Cassandra said, looking down.

"Look, I'm not trying to fuck you here. I've got a boat, and I'm leaving in less than forty-eight hours and need to crew up. Your friendly bartender-pimp says you might be willing to work on a boat instead of whatever it is you do now. You ever work on a boat before? Or anything technical? Maybe sonar or something sonics related?"

"No. I'm a whore. Or, supposed to be. Apparently I'm not very good at that."

"On a boat nobody cares how good you are at fucking. All I need is someone who is good at being alone for long periods of time and listening to mind-numbing ambient noise on the sonar for hours on end without going insane. Think you could do that? Think you might _want_ to do that kind of work?" Percy looked at the skinny young girl skeptically, though in the back of her mind she remembered that her start on submarines had not been much different than this.

[//]: # (Explicitly: this references the fact that Percy did not know anything about subs when she began. Implicitly: that she came from a darker place before subs?)

Cassandra nodded firmly without saying anything, still looking at the floor.

"Good."

"But, wait... isn't working on submarines dangerous? In general, I think I'd rather live in this hole in the ground here than die in a hole out there in the sea."

"It's incredibly fucking dangerous. I won't lie to you about that. But we're compensated for the danger: it pays very well, enough for us to live by our own terms. Enough to buy you out of your current job. That's primarily because there's a limited number of people willing to go out there and carry out their lives encased in a steel tube and surrounded by dangers and fears that would liquefy the guts of most folk. Submariners are an elite class, in their own filthy way."

"What good is wealth and freedom if you are dead though?"

"Look, there's dangerous and there's really fucking dangerous. You'd be mostly working sonar, at least at first. That's about as dangerous as tuning your stereo. You wouldn't have to work down in the engine room or throw lines or anything like that. Heck, you couldn't lift a line even if I needed you to." Percy glanced at Cassandra's arms. "You'd be facing the same base-level danger we all face on a submarine. If we are in a situation where you might die, we'll all be in that situation together. My boat has been running for decades without taking the whole crew down, and I expect she'll run for a couple more decades. That means you aren't going to die any time soon on this boat. Can you live with that?"

Cassandra nodded slowly.

"Now I'm only giving you this little motivational speech about the glories of being a submariner once. If you take the job it's on you to make it a part of yourself, and keep your fear bottled and your mind clear when you are working. Understand? Running a boat is a lot of work and more than anything else I need a crew that can motivate their own fucked-up souls to do their jobs. It's not war, it's commerce."

Cassandra looked around at the dingy canteen and then directly at Percy for the first time. "OK, I'll do it."

"Fine. Get your things together and come down to slip four this evening, ready to leave this place behind you. At the slip ask for Hemi. He'll get you settled and explain how the pay rates work for a green crew member.  We'll train you on board after we're underway in a couple of days. For now, just stay out of the way and keep your mouth shut until someone specifically asks you to do something. Make sure you're always nearby to help the crew, but don't volunteer for anything since you don't know how to do anything. The crew know how to ask for your help when they can use it, and they don't want your help doing things you might fuck up." 

"I understand."

Percy put a heavy hand on Cassandra's shoulder and then turned away from the bar.

"Ahem!" The bartender turned towards them and looked at Percy with one eye and one socket. He rubbed his forefinger and thumb together in the air in front of him. 

"Right." She pulled a stack of coins out of the leather satchel, counted out more than a fair amount, and stood them on the bar. She looked at Cassandra. "That was your first paycheck. Sorry it had to go to that fucking asshole, but it'll be the last one that does."

The bartender put a knuckle to his gristly eyebrow in a mock salute as they turned away again.

"Here," said Percy, handing Cassandra a few coins, "that's an advance on your next paycheck. Buy some tougher clothes."

With a shy smile Cassandra turned to take the ramp towards the stairs to the next level up where the barracks were located. Percy turned down the ramp, feeling like it was probably time to get back to her boat and see how repairs were proceeding.

[//]: # (### Percy meal with Shakes --- hiring him long term.)

 She was warm from the liquor and had a bit of a sweat breaking on her skin in the still and humid underground air. Walking downwards in the direction of the docks her eye caught the now-familiar clanking gait of Shakes coming up the slope. The collection of wrenches at his belt made him always walk like he had a limp. He put his hand up when his eye caught Percy coming towards him. "Captain! I was just coming looking for you. I wanted to talk to you about settling up and getting my boat off your tub."

"Yeah, it's about time for it, eh, Captain Shakes? Let me buy you that meal I promised you first."

"Not going to say no to any fuckin' grub."

Percy reversed direction to join Shakes, and retraced her steps a short way back up the exchange floor. Across from the saloon, set back in the opposite wall was a small eatery. It glowed with orangish-red light that contrasted with the cold blue light of the hall.

Inside they got in line behind other patrons dressed in dingy shades of wool and leather. "Chicken or creamed spinach?" asked the short man with a large gravitational mass behind the row of steaming food as he tapped a long stamped-steel serving spoon against the metal tray.

They got some of each, a mounded plate full of long-grained rice with bits of clove and chopped peas and cardamom scattered in it. Their plates were stacked on steel trays splotched with rust, and a couple of pieces of large crispy flat bread were piled on. Percy handed the tall man at the end of the counter a few coins from her satchel, and they sat down at a chipped Formica table amid the mild roar of basso-voiced dock worker conversations.

Shakes ripped off a piece of the bread and passed it to his other hand while he blew on the tips of his fingers. He moved the bread back to the first hand, then piled a good amount of white rice and green spinach onto it before leaning in and shoving half the wad into his gaping mouth. He picked up a fork with his free hand and helped guide even more of the pile into his gullet.

While he was chewing with bulging cheeks, Percy brought him up to speed. "So I have locked down this job rumor I mentioned. Turns out to pay well. Really fucking well."

Percy dropped the heavy satchel full of coins on the table in front of Shakes. Though when a couple of other patrons turned around to look for the source of that particular sound she realized it was stupid move, so she leaned in and whispered the next bit so only Shakes could hear. "Not to be dramatic, but this is only two-thirds of the payment for this job."

Shakes eyes widened. He poked at the satchel with the handle end of his fork. "Better put that away."

"Before I do, I want to get settled up with you." She removed a handful of coins from the satchel and arranged them in a few neat stacks on the table in front of Shakes. "Is that about the hull rate for the _Gnat_?"

Shakes used his fork to divide off one of the smaller stacks. "The remainder there is about right. After you cover my fuel oil resupply costs, we can call our work together settled."

"Right. Just pass the bill for the fuel oil over to me when you have the _Gnat_ ready to go." She paused to do her own food shoveling. "So the thing about this new job is, it's kinda risky. Might attract some attention from one Authority or another."

"Mmmph," said Shakes through his mouthful of bread, "that's usually how it goes. I assumed that job is behind that sub ramming you."

"Might be. Still seems like a stretch to me though, considering the hold was empty at the time. It was just a dry run..." She drifted off, eating her way along a bone of dry chicken.

"Anyway, this next job is going to require being a little more tactical, I think. A little more forethought and planning."

"I'm not much for fuckin' tactics myself. I have just the one: stay small, stay low in the water, don't get fuckin' seen. It's simple and it works. Not much to think about, and I like it that way."

Percy nodded. "Something like that has always been my strategy too. But for this next job, I think I might need to add a somewhat more complex facet." She scooped a little rice to her mouth. "Remember part of our deal was that if I knew of any work I could connect you with, I would?"

"Sure. You got something already?"

"Here's what I'm thinking: As I said, I'm gonna be hauling this risky fucking load --- I won't get into details about it right now, just know that I'm confident certain Authorities would be interested in checking the manifest. Now, I will, of course, deploy the usual tactics of keeping my boat on the down-low, running quiet, staying submerged during the day and only running on the surface at night, and so on and whatnot."

She paused for a second.

"But I thought: what if in addition to keeping the _Prospect_ stealthy, we also had a partner with another craft of some type. And the partner's job was to be _unstealthy_. To run as a decoy around and above the _Prospect_. Draw away the curious eye --- or ear --- so to speak. And this partner would be clean, of course. Any Authority inspection would turn up an empty hold or a dull cargo of stamped cigars or something."

[//]: # (Is this the plot to Smokey and the Bandit? You fucking know it!)

"Interesting. You want to buy some kind of surface transport or speed boat then?"

"Naw. Surface craft are fucking useless. The authorities have different methods for monitoring surface vessels and submerged ones. It has to be something that could be mistaken on sonar for the _Prospect_. Possibly a boat like the _Gnat_."

Shakes swallowed. "So...what? You want me to juice up the _Gnat_ so it fucking sounds like it could be a big ol' fuckin' cargo sub --- and then you want to hire me to run around and get caught and inspected by various Authorities that might be hunting for the _Prospect_?"

"Or maybe _not_ get caught... You said the _Gnat_ was fast, right? You could outrun them when they started pursuing you...and at the same time lead them away from the _Prospect_."

Shakes started chewing again while he thought. "There is something appealing about the idea of being loud, fast, and --- what's the fuckin' word? brash --- after all these years of trying to sneak around and stay quiet. I can't say I have much experience at that kind of thing, though."

"I have a feeling you'd be a natural."

"It would require a little work on the _Gnat_. I'd have to undo some of the dampening I've put in over the years. And I'd need to tune it up for speed. What are you offering me, exactly?"

"How about hull rate, plus two deck-crew share's worth? And a deck-crew share on this run should be pretty lucrative."

[//]: # (A deck-crew share is kind of the standard pay for a run on a cargo sub. Everyone gets paid per run, and the captain and the deck boss get a much bigger share. Deck-crew shares are what most of the crew makes, evenly divided. Green crew get a much smaller share, or a flat fee offer. The engineer gets an engineers share which is a lot. Maybe equal to deck boss? The boat itself also gets a share: the boat-share. For maintenance and fuel.)

Shakes nodded slowly, while chewing through another piece of bread. "Alright. Fuckin' alright! But I want a stipend on top of that to cover the costs of any modifications to the _Gnat_. And enough to reverse them after we complete this run."

"Done. I'll give you one share right now, and the other on delivery. You can write up the cost of the stipend at delivery too."

"OK! ...Wait, what about my current shipment? I have to get that delivered in the next few days. And I won't be able to do that in a boat making a racket."

"Think you could transship it from the depot here?"

"Maybe. Lots of boats around. Seems like at least one would be going the right direction. But it would have to be someone reliable and discreet."

"Talk to that dock boss, if anyone knows who is reliable around here, seems like it would be her."

"I'll probably take a hit..."

"I will cover the difference, of course."

Shakes nodded and grinned through a mouthful of food. "Well --- partner --- who knew picking up a bunch of fucking filthy marooned scumbags in the middle of the ocean would lead to anything profitable! Fuckin' sweet."

"Well, if that's settled, I've been away from my boat for a couple of hours now, and that is enough for some serious fucking damage to have been done. I feel like I need to be getting back there."

"You go, Captain Percy. I'm going to finish loading up on this chow."

[//]: # (### Back at the Prospect in the docking slip; talking to Hemi about re-hiring Chips)

At docking slip four, the hole in the deck that led down to the cargo hold of the _Prospect_ was like a giant black maw, with lips sucking against the airlock dock of the depot. It now had a number of heavy cables and hoses draped into the hole, as though some kind of enormous dental maneuver was being worked. Percy's eye traced the hoses and wires from fixtures mounted on the walls of the docking bay down over the edge of the hole. She leaned and looked down into the cargo hold where the cables and hoses were lashed together and ran in a hulking pile up the middle of the space back into the deeper parts of the ship, where they were hopefully connected to the battery terminals and fuel tanks that so desperately needed to be topped up. At the front of the cargo hold, Chips was overseeing a repair crew that was working on redoing and reinforcing the messy repair welds she had made earlier.

Percy climbed down the ladder to the catwalk and made her way over and down to the deck of the cargo hold. From there she went aft into the forward battery room, where she found Hemi with a dock worker checking the cables hooked up to the battery bank that were recharging the batteries from the docking bay power system.

"Hemi!" Percy said. "What is that fucking woman still doing on this boat?" She pointed forward to Chips. "Didn't I say she was to be off as soon as we hit the fucking dock?"

"Come here." Hemi led her further back into the battery room. "I convinced her to stay long enough to oversee the repairs. She did not want to be blamed if those guys did a lousy job and the seam burst open again later. So she is just making sure they fix it right."

"Fuck, Hemi! When I fire someone, they stay fucking fired!"

"Sylvia, we need her. I cannot do all these jobs myself. I am a middling welder at best. And I cannot tell the difference in someone else's work between a good weld and a pile of dog waste."

"Owen can take over the welding."

"Owen is just a kid. He cannot tell these dock trolls what to do, even when he does know better than them."

Percy considered. "OK...she oversees the repairs, we pay her up to date, and _then_ she's fucking gone."

"Percy," Hemi said looking directly at her, "we need her. You need to re-hire her. We cannot leave this depot with no engineer and no welder aboard. And in case you had not noticed, there is not exactly a surfeit of talented crew waiting to be hired around this depot."

"Motherfucker." She kicked the battery shelving with her boot. "Fuck! You're right. You're always fucking right and I fucking hate it when you're fucking right. I'll go see if I can re-hire that little fucknut."

"Do it humanely. We need her to actually _want_ to stay and work."

"Speaking of work, remember I promised a plum job for us at this depot? Well I just confirmed it up on the exchange floor. For the moment, we're flush."

"Excellent," said Hemi, though with a note of doubt, knowing that a cargo job that paid well was likely to be neither easy nor safe.

"We also got some free advice: to be gone from the depot within forty-eight hours." She handed him the leather satchel full of coins. "Here's the money. You know how this goes. Spend what you have to to get us out of here quickly."

"It is going to be tricky in this place to throw money around without also getting a bunch of useless hangers-on and value extractors."

"But you're the best deck boss there is for people management, Hemi. I'm sure you can walk that line between getting it done and not getting completely fucking bilked. I should also let you know I hired a new kid to work sonar."

"I am amazed. Seems like there is an unusual lack of green folks on the docks. Does he have any experience?"

"She. And not a bit. But who trains people better than you Hemi? She should be by the boat later, if she doesn't fuckin' skip out from fear." Percy gave him a light punch in the arm as she turned towards the cargo hold. "We can talk details over dinner later. Just keep things moving for the next few hours." She was already out of the battery room and into the cargo hold.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### re-hiring Chips)

Percy picked her way around gear being prepped, moving forward up the cargo hold to stand next to Chips, who had a foul look on her face and her arms crossed as she watched a crew of oversized dock workers sloshing around in the bilge water in tall rubber boots. A couple of them were working a welding rig and bent over the repeatedly stitched-and-patched gash that ran from the bottom of the boat up the curve of the inside of the pressure hull.

"I'm collecting my fuckin' pay and fuckin' leaving as soon as I see that these fuckheads do a job that will hold. You're not pinning any fucking further leaks on me," Chips said to Percy.

"Yeah. Hemi said you would. Thank you for that. How bad is it?"

"When we was on the surface I had it patched up pretty fucking OK, despite half the welds still being under the bilge water. But now the fuckin' boat's under ten or 20 meters of water, and the pressure is causing it to seep, like a wet sucking wound."

They watched the dock workers go at it for a couple of minutes. Then Percy said quietly to Chips, "Umm, it really looks like they're making it worse in places. Kinda fucking up some of your work."

Chips cracked her knuckles and breathed heavily through her nostrils. "Fucking useless fuckin' shit clods," she said under her breath, then: "Hey you fuckers, don't just fucking re-weld the failing fucking patches. Take them out and put _new_ fucking plate steel in. Fuckin' hell!"

There was an incoherent grumbling from the men standing in the puddle.

"Chips," Percy hesitated. "Look, I need an engineer. And I need a welder. You're both of those things and I can't get either of them on this forgotten rock. I need you...at the very least for the next run. Maybe you could stay on until we hit a major port, and then you can find new work there..."

"What the fuck makes you so arrogant to fuckin' think I would go back out with a stubborn fucking ass-reamer like you?" Her face was flushing. "Fucking fuck! You'll fuckin' get me killed with your fuckin' stupidity, and is if that wasn't fucking bad enough, you would tell the story that it was my fucking fault somehow."

"Fuck, Chips! Look at the work these meatheads are doing --- if we don't have you aboard, we're going to go down when it fails and there's nobody who can fix it! Now, I've got a new job coming in, it pays really fucking good. I can offer you a fucking _double_ engineer's share for this next run. I'll even pay you half right fucking now," Percy said, reaching for her satchel full of coins.

"Ah fuck you Percy. You can hold the fucking money. You're a fucking stupid arrogant shithead, but an honest fuckin' one and always fucking paid smartly." Chips pushed at the bilge water edge with the toe of her rubber boot. "Ah, fuck. Look at this fucking work they're fuckin' doing. Y'all going to fucking die without me on board. You, Percy, I don't give two shits. But I couldn't live with fucking Hemi or Owen going down when I could have stopped it."

"Well, me fucking neither Chips."

"OK. You got me. I'm in for the next run --- double fucking engineer share. Now get the fuck away from me before I start looking for another piece of pipe. Actually, I might need one for these fuckers in the puddle anyway," she said looking around.

Percy walked away thinking she would do her best to just stay out of Chips's way on this run --- as much as one could stay out of anyone's way on a sub.

[//]: # (### disconnecting the Gnat)

At the other end of the cargo hold, Percy found Shakes had made his way back from the cafe and was having a conversation with Hemi through the hatch into the forward battery compartment. He stepped a little to one side as she came up so she could join in.

"Captain Percy. Hemi and I are talking about disconnecting my boat from the _Prospect_."

"You got the _Gnat_ refueled already?"

"Naw," said Shakes through a mouthful of oozing leaves, "but if you look back toward the end of the battery compartment, to the hatch down to the _Gnat_, you can see we've still got the _Gnat_'s batteries connected to the circuit. That means since we've been charging the _Prospect_'s batteries," he nodded toward the heavy cables hanging from the _Prospect_'s cargo hatch and running up the middle of the cargo hold, "we've been feeding the _Gnat_ juice too. Hemi here figures there's enough charge on now that I could move the _Gnat_ to its own slip, and refuel there. ...Remembering to send the bill to y'all, of course."

Hemi nodded. "With that mating collar we added, you should be able to dock at one of the regular slips for small boats."

"And bonus," Shakes continued, "now I know the _Gnat_ is good down to thirty meters! Makes a fella proud, ya know, to see the fuckin' fruits of his labors."

Percy looked at Hemi. "Do we have any more use for the _Gnat_ now, Hemi?"

"As a spare battery bank? No. Keeping it connected just slows down our own charging process."

"Alright then," said Percy, "get that leech off my fuckin' boat."

Shakes grinned. "Applying that leech _saved_ your fuckin' boat."

Percy patted him on the arm like a grandmother pleased with the works of a younger generation.

It did not take too long for Hemi to seal Shakes into the _Gnat_ and get it disconnected from the _Prospect_, though Hemi wanted some help coiling and stowing the heavy jumper wires that were no longer needed, and it took a while to find one of the deck crew to help him.

Shakes steered the _Gnat_ further down the docking bay and got it mated up to slip fifteen. After popping the _Gnat_'s hatch at that slip, he started the process of negotiating with the dock workers for finishing the job of getting the batteries charged, and for refueling the fuel ballast tanks. Pretty soon, the _Gnat_ was gorging on its own set of supply lines running down through its sail hatch and into its belly.

[//]: # (### Hemi and Percy have dinner)

Refueling, recharging, and repairs were busily carried out over the next six hours. Percy was uncomfortable with how many people were coming and going --- and crawling around --- inside her boat. In the long expanses of time that she lived in this steel tube, during most of it she knew exactly who was aboard her submarine. But in dock there was unusual and discomforting open access to her boat. Just another reason to be on the move, as far as she was concerned.

All of the activity meant that Hemi was probably spending heavily to get things done quickly. Considering the condition they came in, in normal circumstances they would plan on staying on the dock for a week or two. The damage to the hull meant the _Prospect_ should really go into dry dock for serious repairs --- but that required a monetary flushness that was far beyond a single well-paid job, even if they had no limitations on their time at all. 

Getting the boat ready to go out again so quickly was not just expensive, it also meant cutting some corners that Percy was not happy about. The repairs to the hull continued to be a foul mess of patches and half-competent welds. Through Chips' streaming curses from the bow, Percy got the impression that Chips felt she had done a better job welding underwater while the boat was moving than this whole team of ruddy thick-fingered men were doing with the boat dry and steady.

The only fuel oil Hemi could contract for on the dock on such short notice was a gritty and sludgy bunker. Chips was also not going to be happy about feeding that stuff to her engine.

By dinner time, most of the critical repair and refueling work was wrapping up. Most of the crew took off for the cafe on the exchange floor. Hemi and Percy stayed behind and ate in the _Prospect_'s galley, though they prepped dinner from somewhat fresher food items they had bought off the dock, including a head of cabbage and a bit of gristly meat.

"What's left for us to do, Hemi?"

"We still have to charge the high- and low-pressure tank systems. It would be better to do that from the dock rather than from diesel while we are moving, if we can."

[//]: # (A note here that could go anywhere: Hemi generally does not use contractions. Why? It's a mix of his being smart, educated, and English being his second language. He decided at some point it would be a simpler language for him to master --- and have precision over what he was saying --- if he avoided contractions.)

Percy nodded.

"And we should take on some more food, refill the fresh-water tanks, and lay in a normal spread of spare parts..."

"I did try to start buying parts earlier today but got sidetracked discussing the job offer. Put Gregory on securing our food stocks. And tell him I need more cigarillos."

Hemi nodded and jotted a note on a scrap of paper clipped to a clipboard that lay next to his plate. "You are sure about this job Sylvia?"

"You saw the fucking money! And that's only two-thirds of it."

"I do not trust jobs that pay _too_ well. Cargo?"

"Weapons parts --- magnetic warheads."

"Ah. Had to be something like that, did it not? You have no problem with Authorities breathing down our necks and taking on the risk of someone blowing the boat in half if a crate full of explosives is dropped?"

"We're on the fuckin' Nitro Express now, Hemi. _Someone_ has to move this stuff. Might as well be pros like us. The cargo is supposed to arrive for loading any minute now, actually. Is the hold ready for it?"

"Chips finished up repairs an hour or two ago --- at least as repaired as could be with the resources available here --- and the bilge is pumped dry. I think we can start loading cargo. Though if we are hauling explosives, you might want to pack in some soft batting first."

"I'm sure they have been thoroughly packed and duly deactivated...though it would be good if you took a peek at them before they get settled so you --- Hemi --- are sure they won't go off if someone walks by a crate with a heavy socket wrench or something."

There was a tap of someone's knuckle on the hatch to the galley, and Gregory swung it open a bit. He downed the last of an ice cream sandwich he had been working on and tossed the wrapper in the sink. "Back from dinner, Cap. Bunch more of those fuckin' big trolls up at the slip with crates they say are to be loaded into the cargo hold."

"That is indeed our cargo. You can come help us get 'em stowed properly. Hemi?"

Hemi forked his last bite of meat and squeezed his bulk out of the tight galley bench seat.

[//]: # (### Loading the magnetic warheads)

They climbed up the ladder from the catwalk to the depot docking bay to find dozens of large and molding wooden crates stacked up around the open hatch into the _Prospect_'s cargo hold. The sides of the crates were stamped with "XL Industries" and "CAUTION!" Apparently XL Industries knew better than to put the word "EXPLOSIVES" on their packing materials, with the attendant risk that would bring of attracting unnecessary attention during an inspection. But XL Industries still felt that anyone handling their products should have a heads up that they should not be tossed around casually.

Making their way about the crates were a half dozen or so dock workers --- more huge swarthy men wearing moth-eaten tweed and leather suits, chomping on various forms of tobacco or seeds. They swarmed around a large pushcart stacked high with the wooden "Caution" crates. They were unloading the cart, lifting the crates by chains suspended from a sliding hoist that hung from anchor points welded to the roof of the depot's docking bay tube. This sliding hoist would be used to lower the crates down into the cargo hold of the _Prospect_. A couple of men made their way down to the deck of the cargo hold where they would receive the lowered crates.

A dock worker approached Percy. He was wearing a worn bowler hat and was among the smallest men Percy had seen since they docked --- his eyes were almost even with hers and were surrounded by round-framed glasses.

"You're Captain Percy, right?" he asked.

She nodded.

"This shipment is from Miss Mai. Sign here." He held out a pen and handed her a clipboard he was carrying, which bore a long sheet with tiny type printed on it and a signature blank at the end.

Percy took the pen and scrawled her illegible name into the blank.

"This document should have a witness too. Can he witness?" the dock worker asked, motioning his head towards Hemi.

"Yeah. Hemi, put your scrawl on that fucking thing."

Hemi adjusted his glasses and more studiously scanned over the contract before he signed the witness blank. The man tore off a carbon copy and held it out to Percy. Hemi took it, folded it, and put it into his inside jacket pocket.

By the time this was done the dock crew already had the first crate in a sling suspended by chains and hanging out over the _Prospect_'s open cargo hold. The chain passed through a series of iron wheels in the hoist to a fat winch mounted to the wall of the docking bay. The chains looked like they were straining with tension at the edge of their capacity --- explosives were never a light cargo. One of the big fellows was at the winch. "OK, I'm letting out some of the fuckin' winch now!" he yelled over to his mates at the cargo hold entrance. They relayed the update down to the men on the deck of the _Prospect_'s cargo hold.

"Gregory, my attractive friend," Percy said, "go down to the cargo hold deck and make sure those goons are stowing things in a way that won't leave the boat totally fuckin' untrimmable."

"Sure, Cap." Gregory disappeared down the ladder into the cargo hold.

With much relayed yelling, the men got the first crate lowered down into the hold, then cranked the chains back up, slung the second crate, and repeated the process. Soon they had a clanking and yelling rhythm going and the hold of the _Prospect_ steadily filled with crates. Hemi and Percy watched, looking down through the hatch into the hold. As the dock workers moved the crates into the sub, they arranged them like puzzle pieces, and then lashed them with thumb-thick hemp rope to fixed loops welded to the pressure-hull walls.

Gregory was making sure the crates were being stacked, stowed, and lashed down in such a way that the boat was not going to dive bow-first into the globigerinous ooze as soon as they separated it from the docking bay. But he was working fast, maybe a little too quickly. Percy and Hemi knew even if Gregory stowed the crates carefully, the crew would likely have to make some adjustments to the balance of the load later to get the boat trimmed as efficiently as possible. The key priority for Gregory was simply to make sure the crates were organized so that making those adjustments later, while they were underway, would not be too difficult.

[//]: # (### Cassandra arrives at the Prospect)

In the middle of the loading, Cassandra approached, a large canvas rucksack slung on the thin frame of her body. She also held over-stuffed canvas satchels in each hand. She had apparently taken Percy's advice, and now wore duck pants and a button-down shirt made of thick cotton, though the new clothes hung loosely on her. Percy was happy to see she had also procured some rubber-soled boots. That Cassandra had managed to put together some reasonable work wear in such a short time suggested good things to Percy about Cassandra's future aboard the boat. 

Percy was always on the lookout for little signs that a crew member might last beyond a single run. Green crew came and went on submarines like late-spring snows. A captain could hire a few in one port and they would all evaporate at the next, replaced by equally unskilled new crew. It was a tough job, and only those with a certain hardness of character managed to continue in the lifestyle. The others gave up, and, presumably, made their way back to the surface world to see what kind of life they could eke out in one territorial authority or another.

Percy tapped Hemi and nodded in the direction of Cassandra huffing her way down to the docking bay. "That's our new sonar watch."

Hemi looked up from his clipboard and sized Cassandra up for a moment. "I hope she can steer or hear, because I do not know what else we could do with her."

"We could make her deck boss."

"Or captain."

Cassandra made her way up to them, weaving through the remaining crates.

"Cassandra," said Percy, "I'm glad you made it. This is Hemi Howell, Deck Boss, First Mate, Navigator, Crew Trainer, and whatever the fuck else needs to be done. Basically he's the one who does all the actual work."

"Nice to meet you Hemi," said Cassandra. Percy could have sworn that if she were wearing a skirt and unburdened by all the possessions she owned, she would have curtsied.

"Genuinely glad to have you aboard," said Hemi. "We desperately need more hands, and with you taking a watch, we all might actually be able to get a little sleep on this run."

Cassandra smiled up at Hemi.

Hemi gestured with the end of his pencil. "Down that ladder into the boat. Walk up the catwalk till you get to the main decks of the boat. Introduce yourself to anyone who does not look like one of these mounds." He nodded towards the men working on loading the explosives. "Ask them where the crew quarters are. You should be able to find an empty locker to stow your stuff in. Then make your way up to the sonar compartment and hang around until someone asks you to do something."

"Alright," said Cassandra. "And I'll get some training at some point?"

"Not until we are underway. Getting the boat ready for a run takes a lot of prep, as you can see, and there is no extra time for anything but prep. Once we are underway there will be some downtime, and I will sit with you at the sonar and show you how it works."

"Sounds good. So I'll see you both later. Thanks again for the job." She gave a little wave and looked down the ladder into the cargo hold before tossing the bags in her hand down to the catwalk, and then swinging her tiny self out onto the ladder with her big pack behind her like some kind of distended insect. She lowered herself to the catwalk.

Percy watched this approvingly. It was another good sign that Cassandra seemed so intuitively comfortable with the vertical up-and-down lifestyle of a submarine.

Hemi did not fail to notice, either. "Maybe..." was all he said before looking back down at his clipboard and counting how many more crates remained to be loaded.

The loading was finished that evening. Hemi had Bastian, Gregory, and Owen go over every crate and make sure it was lashed securely enough that it could not shift once the _Prospect_ started moving. 

After that, most of the crew headed up to the canteen on the exchange floor to indulge in the kind of heavy drinking rarely on offer to a submarine crew, though Cassandra excused herself from this opportunity to get to know her new crew mates better, suggesting politely that she had seen quite enough of that canteen. Hemi and Percy also skipped the drinking and were up late in the galley, going over the state of their supplies and discussing some questions Hemi had about the details of the job contract that he wanted to be sure Percy had considered. It was long after midnight before they crawled into their respective racks.
