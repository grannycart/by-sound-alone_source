[//]: # (### Next morning; loading compressed air)

[//]: # (Morning: day 1, run to Stilt City)
The next morning, Hemi was up first, and dragged a bleary and aching Bastian out of the rack to help him track down some dock workers who knew how to set up the rig that would recharge the compressed air tanks on the _Prospect_. This would involve assembling a length of rigid pipe down the docking bay, through the cargo hatch, and connecting it to fittings mounted to the ceiling of the _Prospect_'s cargo hold. It had to be rigid pipe the whole way because Hemi wanted to recharge the high-pressure tanks in the _Prospect_, and that air was under such immense pressure it would blow apart any kind of flexible pipe material. Once they had the high-pressure tanks filled, Hemi could recharge the low-pressure tanks as well via some valves on the tank ballast panel in the control room that would allow him to bleed off air from the high-pressure system to the low-pressure tanks.

Refilling a docked submarine's high-pressure tanks was an unusual operation. Since a sub should be ready for an emergency at any time, they normally docked with their high-pressure tanks fully charged. The docking bay's high-pressure system was mostly just kept ready for a flooding emergency where water might have to be blown out. The docking bay had the equipment to refill a sub's system --- with pipes that fed down from compressors located in a machine room up above the exchange floor --- but only a handful of people knew how to use it. So Hemi spent the first few hours of the morning wandering around the docking bay and the exchange floor with Bastian and a bag full of money looking for those people.

By the time they got back, the rest of the crew had managed to crawl slowly and painfully out of their racks, get themselves fed and coffeed, and busy themselves with odd jobs around the boat while waiting for Hemi to return with instructions about what actually needed to get done. Hemi sent Gregory and Cassandra up to the exchange floor with a stack of coins to track down enough food and consumable supplies to get the crew through the run ahead of them. He figured Cassandra had been in this depot long enough that she might be able to help Gregory acquire some better-than-average submarine grub. Chips had Owen down in the engine room carefully going over the diesels and the motors. Hemi was neither going to disrupt Chips in that process, nor take Owen from her for something else.

Hemi and Bastian worked with the two men from the depot who knew how to rig the high-pressure pipes until they had a spindly and unwieldy-looking hook of pipe that arced through the air from the docking bay down into the _Prospect_. It took a while to get all the segments set up and double checked so that everyone working on it was confident it was not going to explode and blow every submarine off the docking bay when they let the high-pressure air into it. But once it was set up, charging the high-pressure tanks only took a few minutes.

With the compressed air systems recharged, the only thing left was to get food aboard. Gregory and Cassandra returned a couple of hours later with a cart of yet more wooden crates, this time filled with food stores. Gregory and Bastian got these crates lowered down to the cargo hold deck with Cassandra watching and learning, but staying out of the way. Once they were in the cargo hold, Bastian stowed and lashed the crates full of non-perishable and dry goods --- cans and dried meats, oatmeal, cornmeal, flour, apples, rice, eggs, cabbage, jars of spices, and citrus --- with the rest of the cargo, figuring they could move the contents up to the galley after they were under way. The crew immediately pulled out the frozen and perishable items --- sides of beef and pork, a couple of waxed-paper boxes of leafy vegetables they would need to cook in the next few days, frozen chicken carcasses, and ice cream sandwiches among other things --- and carried them up to be stowed in the galley and freezers.

Having completed all the restock and resupply work, Hemi found Percy in the sonar compartment around midday and reported that all the various umbilicals had been withdrawn, and the _Prospect_ was ready to swim under its own power again. They could expect to be ready to embark from the depot sometime that day.

"I do not know if you have any business left to take care of up on the exchange floor or anything else," said Hemi, "but the cargo is loaded, all the critical supplies are aboard, Chips says the engines are running cleanly enough, and the boat is more or less repaired."

"Nice work, Hemi. Do we have any money left?"

"Well, we have been spending coin with a shovel to get all this done quickly. But even after covering Shakes's costs, we should still come out a bit ahead."

"Clandestine work does fuckin' pay, don't it?"

"If it does not kill you in the process."

Bastian's narrow form suddenly filled the hatchway forward to the next compartment. He stood aside and one of the scruffy teenagers who hung around the depot looking for quick jobs stepped into the sonar compartment.

"Captain Percy, this kid says he has a message for you."

The messenger handed Percy a scrap of paper and began fidgeting with the buckles on his vest while he waited for Percy to indicate whether she would want to send a reply.

Percy unfolded the paper. Written in a slightly wavering hand in printed capital letters was: IT IS TIME TO LEAVE.

Hemi put a couple of things together. "A message from our employer?"

"Indeed," said Percy. "Raise the Blue Peter, Hemi.  Time to move on from this place."

Hemi nodded and climbed up to the control room. A second later, his voice reverberated through the ship over the PA as he told the crew to prepare to embark.

"Bastian," said Percy, "get on the sonar rig and have a listen."

Bastian sat down at the sonar station, put the headphones over his ears, and flipped on the power to the unit. "Is there anything in particular I'm listening for here, Captain? We are docked, after all. Probably not much out there to hear."

"It's just a feeling, not something particular. But I'd like to keep the fucking surprises to a minimum." Percy looked at the messenger. "Hang out a second, kid. I think I've got another job for you."

The kid spun around the chair next to Bastian and sat down in a long-legged slouch.

"Hemi!" Percy leaned back to call up to him in the control room. "Start working that embark checklist."

"Already started it, Sylvia," he called back down.

Gregory and Cassandra showed up in the sonar compartment a minute later, ready for instructions.

"Gregory, take Cassandra and go find a dock crew who can work the other side of the slip hatch. Be ready to seal the _Prospect_'s cargo hatch when you hear from Hemi." She jerked a thumb at the messenger, "but make sure this guy is off before you do."


[//]: # (### the sinking of the inspection sub)

As Gregory and Cassandra disappeared forward, Bastian broke in. "Captain Percy, there's definitely something happening out there." He paused for a minute, listening. "Fucking torpedo in the water!"

Percy pushed past the messenger kid's legs and pulled on the spare sonar headset. She stood behind Bastian, concentrating on the sound in the headphones.

She could hear the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a torpedo prop spinning. She reached over Bastian and adjusted the direction of the underwater mics. She looked at the readings from the sonar panel. "It's running just at the surface," she said. "It's not coming towards us --- or the depot...some other target..."

She slowed her breathing and listened: a confused mix of white noises layered on top of one another. But there was more than one prop spinning in the water. Below the whine of the torpedo, she could hear the slow revolutions of a ship screw. It was nearly silent, and difficult to hear. She leaned over Bastian and flipped some switches, adjusting the filters to try to muffle the torpedo whine.

She could tell by the revolutions and the pitch that the other prop belonged to a relatively small craft. It was so quiet it could only be an electric motor --- that made it a submarine. It took her just a second longer to figure it out. "Someone fucking fired on the depot's little inspection sub," she said.

"Maybe someone wasn't enamored with the quality of their hospitality," said Bastian.

The little inspection sub was fairly maneuverable, and they were taking evasive action. Percy could hear the pitch of their screw change in her headphones as they put on speed, turned, and dove to try to escape the path of the incoming warhead. Then she heard the ping of the torpedo's sonar echoing off the small submarine. 

"The torpedo found them. It's homing," Bastian said. A slow minute ticked by, and every second, the bouncing ping of the torpedo got faster in Percy's headset. She motioned to Bastian and they both took their headsets off. There was silence in the sonar room. The messenger kid managed to look bored. 

Then they all heard a low-pitched rumble resonate through the hull of the _Prospect_.

"Sounds like they were hit," Hemi shouted down from the control room.

Percy put the headphones on and made some further adjustments to the filter switches. She could hear the creaking hull of the small submarine. She could hear welded seams splitting, and the streams of bubbles pouring out of it. She looked at the ranging readout on the sonar rig. The water was deep where the little sub was. It was falling down the hole. 

"They've been fuckin' sunk." Percy said, turning her head slightly and pitching her voice loud enough for Hemi to hear.

In her headphones, the groaning hull's pitch changed as it dropped farther down the water column into the colder, denser water where sound found new rules by which it could propagate. The groan turned to a low rattling whine.

And then Percy heard a crunching pop. And she heard a huge bubble of air escape, the life-bubble of whoever was inside that submarine, squeezed out of it instantaneously as the broken little sub sank beyond its crush depth. The compressed carcass of the sub made no more sound, but she sat listening for a few seconds to the rushing sound of the bubble as it climbed the distance to the surface.

[//]: # (### they throw lines)

Percy took off the sonar headset and laid it on its hook. "We gotta get the fuck out of here," she said. Then, louder, so Hemi could hear, "Hemi! We need to get out of here!"

Bastian nodded, the other sonar headset still on his ears.

"Right, Sylvia. I concur," said Hemi from above.

"Here, kid." Percy ripped a piece of scrap paper from the pad at Bastian's elbow. She scribbled on it with a pencil and handed it to the messenger. "That's for a guy who goes by 'Shakes.' He's got a small boat at one of the slips. Find him and give him that message." She dug a few coins from her pocket and handed them to him.

The messenger was off with an energy one would never have suspected by the lethargy that had engulfed his sitting form just a few moments before.

Hemi's voice came over the PA. *"Everyone be ready to toss lines. Gregory, get the cargo hatch buttoned up, and let me know when you are ready. Owen, come up to the control room."*

"I hope we didn't forget anything," Bastian said.

"I'd rather leave some stuff behind than be sucked onto a fuckin' slip when whoever fired that torpedo arrives here," said Percy.

Gregory's voice came over the ship PA. *"Hemi, the cargo hatch is sealed and flooded. You can let go the docking clamps whenever you're ready. Cassandra and I are headed towards the sonar compartment."*

Percy could hear Hemi's voice take on a soft professional tone as he got on the ship-to-ship radio and notified the docking control office they intended to depart.

A minute later, Owen appeared. He took a rag from a hook on the wall and wiped his hands that were blackened with grease.

Percy motioned him up the ladder. "I think Hemi wants you in one of the control seats. We gotta get outta here. Is Chips ready to go in the engine room?"

"Well, she's got all the compressed air lines off one of the diesels to check and clean 'em," he answered her as they were both climbing into the control room. "She's not going to be thrilled about finishing that job up while the boat is moving. And she cursed Hemi up and down the meridian for requesting me up here."

[//]: # (Referring to the compressed-air lines used to turn the diesels over when starting the engines.)

"That's a minor job, she can handle it on her own. And we'll be running on batteries for quite a while, so she can take her time getting that diesel ready to start again."

"Owen, I need you up here in the throttle seat," Hemi said when they were standing in the control room.

Gregory arrived a few moments later and Hemi gestured him into the other control seat.

"No problem with the dock crew getting the hatch sealed?" Hemi asked Gregory.

"Well, after that explosion sound, the whole dock went a little crazy. I think, like us, a lot of submariners have taken that as a signal to leave. But for a couple of coins I got that messenger kid to seal up the dock side hatch and flood it for us."

"Excellent," said Hemi.

Percy looked down through the hatch to the sonar compartment and saw Cassandra standing quietly off to the side. Percy leaned down and motioned to the second sonar operator's seat and the spare headset. "Sit over there, Cassandra. Put that headset on and start to familiarize yourself with the sonar rig."

Cassandra moved to sit next to Bastian without a word.

It was time for Percy to get her boat out from under the docking bay. "So we're ready to fuckin' go, right?" she asked Hemi.

"Correct," Hemi replied, "I have been keeping the tanks trimmed with just a bit of positive buoyancy while we have been docked to keep us pressed firmly up against the mating collar of the slip, so we will have to take on some water after we release."

Percy nodded. It was a standard maneuver for a docking situation like this one. "OK, let go the docking clamps." 

Hemi picked up the ship-to-ship mic and told the docking control office they were leaving. He did not wait for them to reply before reaching over and flipping the switch that operated the electro-magnets in the docking clamps. The clamps reversed with a loud clunk that echoed up the length of the _Prospect_'s hull.

"I am going to open the main ballast vent valves," Hemi warned the other crew members with him in the control room. He stepped up to the tank trim control panel and rolled open each of the wheels controlling the ballast valves.

There was a hiss of air escaping from the boat and the _Prospect_ fell slowly downwards under their feet. 

"We are off the docking slip. Put us in reverse and back us away from the dock. No reason to risk hitting the sail trying to swim under the dock tube," Hemi said to no one in particular. But since Owen was sitting at the throttle controls, the implication of who was responsible for this maneuver was clear.

Owen pulled the throttle controls backwards, and they felt a small acceleration towards the rear.

"Control room!" Bastian shouted up from the sonar station. "There's fucking boats everywhere in the water! Seems like no one wants to be hanging around this shithole anymore. You're going to have to move slowly to get out of here without hitting one of them."

"The last thing any of them wants is to move slowly and cautiously right now, of course," Percy said to Hemi who was holding the leather strap over the captain's station.

"That might be exactly what whoever fired that torpedo was thinking," put in Gregory. "Scare all the fuckin' mice away and take the cheese for themselves."


[//]: # (### They escape under the pursuing sub)

Hemi was too busy considering his options to respond. He was counting seconds to himself, reckoning how much time there was until the _Prospect_'s bow was backed out from under the dock. As soon as he was sure they were clear, he leaned over Owen and put the throttle slightly into the forward position, waited until the boat slowed to nearly a stop, and then backed off to no throttle. It was too dangerous to keep reversing --- there was no way to know if another boat was behind them. "Bastian," Hemi called down to sonar, "I need sea room --- some safe space to maneuver in."

"Right Boss, hang on." A full minute passed. "It sounds like you can come about to 180, nobody moving directly to the south of us."

"OK then. Owen, creep forward, port to 180 degrees." Hemi said. "Bastian, continue to ensure we are not about to run into anyone."

"Right Boss!" Bastian repeated.

The _Prospect_ put a tiny, silent amount of speed on. They crawled out of the docking area, with Bastian --- swinging the sonar mics back and forth rapidly --- trying to make sure he was hearing every contact and understood where each was going. It was a good first lesson in sonar for Cassandra, though she found herself wildly confused by all the different sounds, their meanings, and their correlations to the range and heading calculations. She listened with an anxious look on her face.

"You'll get the fuckin' hang of it eventually," Bastian said to her quietly so as not to lose track of what was happening in his earphones. "Or...you fuckin' won't. Seems to me like people either get sonar, or they don't. There's no in between."

Cassandra hardly looked reassured.

"Hemi!" Bastian called up. "New contact. Coming in fast from the east, port-side." A few seconds passed. "I'd say, fairly big sub, pretty noisy amount of fucking water running along the hull. Fully submerged, and just charging towards the docking area."

"That's probably the one that did the firing," Hemi said to Percy.

"Let's put some distance between us and that boat," said Percy.

Hemi, with the intuitive three-dimensional thinking of an experienced submariner, understood immediately that when Percy said "distance" she did not mean horizontal distance, like on a chart. To achieve that kind of distance would require increasing speed, and increasing speed would create enough motor noise that they could be heard and tracked. Hemi looked at the depth-under-keel gauge, already showing a hundred meters or so to the bottom and dropping fast as they moved away from the seamount the depot island was built atop of. "Some distance it is, Captain. Gregory, down plane, please."

[//]: # (Hemi thinks three-dimensionally, unlike Khan! Could not resist a way-too-subtle Star Trek reference.)

As Gregory turned the dive plane wheel and steered the boat into the depths, Hemi stepped to the tank control panel and opened the valve to flood the forward fast-dive tank. Water sloshed through the ship, and the bow pitched downward. Percy and Hemi, standing, tightened their grips on the overhead straps.

Percy reached for some switches on the wall that changed the lighting to night lighting. The white lights faded away and red bulbs came on bathing them all in a sanguine glow. It was not strictly necessary --- night lighting was intended to preserve the night-vision for anyone who needed to look through the periscope --- but Percy was of the school that believed in switching to night lighting in any situation where she needed her crew to remain alert. The red light served as a constant reminder that they needed their sharpest skills and tactics.

"Keep us close to that seamount," said Percy. "It will give us extra cover if they decide to use their active sonar."

"No reason not to make a tricky operation even trickier," said Hemi. "Bastian, are we clear of the traffic abandoning the depot?"

"Ya," said Bastian, "they all scattered pretty fuckin' quickly."

"Any of them going deep?"

"Doesn't sound like it. I think we're the only ones who took that particular route."

Hemi had Owen bring the bow around and they sank obliquely, traveling close to and across the sloping wall of the seamount.

"Two hundred meters down. Depth-under-keel: twenty meters to the wall of the seamount," said Gregory.

Hemi looked at Percy. He was not going to level off the dive until she said so.

"Two hundred and ten meters. Still descending," said Gregory.

"Ah, ya fucking fuckturds!" Chips's voice came up from the sonar compartment, where she had just entered. "Is your fuckin' goal to see if you can split open that fucking weak-ass seam those fucking dock beasts welded in the cargo hold? Because that's what it fucking looks like to me. The very first fuckin' thing you do off the dock is push the boat into the fuckin' hole!"

"For fuck's sake Chips! If it's a choice between going deep or being fucking torpedoed, we're going deep," Percy replied. After a short pause, she said to herself, "I need a fuckin' smoke." She suddenly realized she had not smoked since the last time the _Prospect_ was moving. 

"Oh, here!" Gregory pulled a paper packet from his pocket and tossed it to Percy. "They didn't have the cigarillos you like, so I got you a carton of these cheroots."

Percy opened the packet. "This tobacco is as black as used motor oil." She sniffed. "Smells like petroleum too. These are going to be rough smokes. Still, better than fuckin' cigarettes. Thanks." She slid one of the thin cheroots from the packet with her lips and lit it from a match she struck on the hull. 

She sucked on the cheroot and the thought came to her that Chips probably was not totally wrong about the quality of the welding work in the cargo hold. "Let's level her off, Gregory."

"Ah, fuck! Ya fuckheads are going to want the fuckin' diesels any fucking minute now too, I'm sure --- and they're in fuckin' pieces." Chips smacked her hand against the bulkhead and hobbled back down towards engineering.

"Leveled out at two-twenty meters," said Gregory. "I'm going to make some adjustments to the trim tanks, see if I can get us floating evenly."

As Gregory started opening and closing valves on the trim tank control panel, the hull of the _Prospect_ let out a long groan.

"Easy, my pretty lady," Percy whispered to her boat.

Hemi monitored Gregory's work on the trim. When he was satisfied, he got them moving slowly and silently out into the deep ocean. "Creep speed --- three knots, Owen. You can steer us away from the seamount wall now."

They slunk away from the depot through the pitch deep. The depth-under-keel gauge rapidly climbed until it pegged itself on the "bottomless" pin.

From sonar, Bastian reported that he thought he could hear some disturbing sounds from the depot, but could not pin down any specific thing that might be happening.

[//]: # (### looking at the charts)

[//]: # (Mid-afternoon: day 1, run to Stilt City)
The _Prospect_ continued on its course, slowly, silently, and steadily, through the blackness, under more than two hundred meters of water. After a couple of hours of creeping, Percy flipped the white lights back on, which everyone understood to mean that the situation had returned to something like normal, even though it remained nothing like safe to continue running beyond the edge of their normal operating depth.

"Hemi, join me at the navigation station. It's time for us to figure out where we're going," said Percy.

They climbed down the ladder and turned the lights on over the navigation table. Hemi unsealed and unrolled a new chart and laid it down under the glass. He wiped the old grease pencil marks off with a rag.

"I got us a more up-to-date chart at the depot," Hemi said. "Look, the depot is here. And..." He looked over some notes on their current course and speed from a clipboard he had been updating over the last couple of hours, then put a small x on the glass, not far from the deserted island that held the depot. "I estimate we are about here, now."

Percy pointed to a hashed arc printed on the chart that ran past one side of the depot island. "Is that the actual current Authority demarcation line?"

"Yes it is," said Hemi. "Western Federated Socialists on the east side of it, Consolidated States of the Archipelago Islands on the west side of it." He looked at the date printed in the corner of the chart. "At least as of the printing of this chart, eight months ago."

"We need to head toward Stilt City. But I think we should take a slightly less than direct course." Percy drew an arcing route on the chart with the tip of her finger. She indicated a point on the arc. "I asked Shakes to rendezvous with us here. I hired him to help us out on this run."

"Good. And yes, further into the Consolidated States waters will be better. They are far less likely to bother us, and we can travel for a few days while remaining in their waters. But..." He took another chart from the stack of rolled charts and unrolled it in front of Percy. "To get to Stilt City, we eventually have to head through these waters in the south. A highly contested area. At least three --- up to five --- Authorities all claiming parts of it."

"Well, we'll just have to be fucking careful when we move through there. We'll be disciplined about running on the surface only at night, and max out our underwater time during the day."

"...In addition to the regular trouble we might encounter with Authorities, there is also that sub with the ram. My guess is they are the ones who fired on the depot patrol sub. It is possible they followed us there."

"This isn't a rush job, Hemi. We have the time to take it slow and do the stealth thing right. Let's just be careful, be silent, and not be found. We'll deliver the cargo, collect our money, and by that time we'll be a few territories away --- an entirely different part of the world --- from wherever that sub with the ram came from. I'll bet we never see that ugly fuckin' boat again."

"I hope you are right." Hemi paused, running through his mental checklist of all the things that kept the boat going. "Another thing I wanted to bring up with you is that while we were adjusting the trim, it looked like the boat is a little by the bow."

"Hardly surprising; we never seem to be able to load cargo in a way that doesn't throw off the fucking balance."

"True. I would like to bring some of the crew down to the cargo hold and shift cargo back towards the middle of the boat. See if we can get it stowed so it trims more evenly."

"Sure, but let's run a little longer first. At our current rate we've only made maybe a dozen nautical miles from the depot so far."

"Think we can risk a little more speed yet?"

Percy considered. "I think so. Take us up to six knots. Only top sonar people deliberately looking for us could hear us at six knots at this range and depth. In a few hours more, we'll come up a bit shallower and you can start rearranging the hold."

"Sounds good," said Hemi as he started climbing back up to the control room to have Owen increase the throttle.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)

[//]: # (### trimming the boat to handle the cargo load)

[//]: # (Late-afternoon: day 1, run to Stilt City)
Six knots was still slow, but twice the speed at which they had crawled away from the depot. With three more hours of cruising, they were out of range of all but the very best sonar gear and ears in the world. Percy had them come up to one hundred meters to take some of the strain off the hull.

When the boat reached this shallower depth, Hemi stationed himsefl in front of the tank trim control panel and made adjustments, pushing water back and forth across the boat. "Sylvia," he said as she stood behind him, smoking, "I'm working the trim here, but I think we can certainly do better if we move some of the cargo around down in the hold."

"OK. Take Owen and Bastian down there with you. I'll watch the trim with Gregory in case she starts to lean or something... And keep in mind that trim could be the least of our problems if you drop any of those fucking crates."

Hemi tapped Owen on the shoulder, and they climbed down to the sonar compartment, where Bastian joined them on the trip down to the cargo hold.

It still smelled damp when they stuck their noses into the cargo hold and Hemi brought the lights up. Hemi was certain the quilted patchwork of steel and frozen slag that covered the split seam of the hull was continuing to seep. They might never have a completely dry cargo hold again. That was OK; that was what bilge pumps were for. But the accumulating bilge water was another good reason to shift the cargo and get some play in the boat trim.

Gregory had stacked the wooden crates into the hold inexpertly. There was a bit of an art to it, and Gregory had only the beginnings of the necessary skill. The crates had been initially laid down all the way up the length of the hull along the sides. This was a good start, forming the base for putting the rest of the crates on the top. But then Gregory had gotten lazy and stacked the additional layers of crates mostly toward the bow. That was easier to do and kept the crates out of the way for crew moving in and out of the cargo hold, but put more weight in the bow than Hemi wanted. They needed to move some of the upper layers of the crates in the front toward the rear of the cargo hold while still leaving enough room for the crew to get through.

Hemi had Owen rig a hoist and chain to sliding fixtures on the roof of the cargo hold. Then Owen could climb up on the stack and throw straps around each crate they wanted to move. Hemi and Bastian would pull the chain while Owen guided it off the stack. The individual crates were only modestly sized but surprisingly heavy, requiring Hemi and Bastian's full combined power to lift them, even with the mechanical advantage of the hoist. The three of them would then drag the airborne crate up the length of the cargo hold with the hoist sliding along the rails. Then Owen and Bastian would push it with poles while Hemi lowered it to its new place.

Every so often they would come across one of the food crates that had not been stowed in the galley earlier, and they would have to interrupt their re-arranging work to unpack the food and move it up to the galley.

[//]: # (Early-evening: day 1, run to Stilt City)
It ended up taking a few hours to complete a first pass at rearranging the hold. When Hemi felt like the weight distribution might be good, he left Owen and Bastian smoking in the cargo hold while he ran up to the control room. There, Hemi and Percy made slight adjustments to the trim of the boat, before Hemi returned to the cargo hold to move a few more crates around. It took another hour and three more trips up to the control room before Hemi was happy with the way the cargo sat and the boat was trimmed.

"Fuckin' A, Hemi," said Gregory when Hemi was finally settled back into the control room, "seemed like the boat was trim enough when we left the fuckin' depot. Didn't slow us down none."

"A submarine is like the hairs on the back of your neck, Gregory. It _always_ needs a trim."

[//]: # (### Training Cassandra on sonar)

Hemi knew Percy would keep the same course, depth, and speed until well after dark, and that was still a few hours off yet, so there was little for him to do for the moment. He took the opportunity to start training Cassandra on sonar. 

In the sonar compartment, he sent Bastian off for coffee and a smoke and sat down next to Cassandra.  "You have been listening for the last few hours while Bastian worked the sonar, correct?" Hemi asked her.

Cassandra nodded.

"Any of it make any sense?"

"Do you want me to lie?"

"There is nothing to be concerned about. It is not as complex as it might seem. Except for the parts that are, but we will get to those as we come to them. Put your headset over both ears... You need both ears to get a full sense of what any sound you hear on sonar is doing."

Cassandra adjusted the headset so it sat evenly, with the headphones covering both her ears. 

"OK," said Hemi as he began adjusting and tuning the sonar unit, "this is the 'passive' sonar rig. You can think of it as being nothing more than microphones for listening underwater. There's 'active' sonar too --- that's a lot more complicated: active sonar sends a ping out and we listen for its echo. We do not use that often so do not worry about it for now. Passive is simpler, you are just listening, passively. Understand?"

Cassandra nodded.

"The main thing you need to know for operating the sonar is that you can aim the underwater microphones in a specific direction using this thing that looks like a steering wheel." Hemi turned the stainless steel wheel a half turn. "See that dial there? That shows you which way the microphones are pointed. It goes around 360 degrees. At some point someone will ask you to listen in a specific direction. They will give you the degrees and you just turn the wheel until the needle on that dial shows you are aiming the mics in the direction they are asking about. Make sense?"

"That seems simple enough," said Cassandra.

"That part is. It will get a lot more complex when we start using the filters and transducers to tune in on a contact later. The thing is, the ocean is never absolutely silent. Let's start by just listening to what we hear on the sonar where there are no specific contacts we are trying to focus in on." Hemi and Cassandra both remained quiet for a minute with the background sound of the ocean washing through their headphones. "OK, Cassandra. What do you hear?"

"I don't know..." She waved one small hand absently. "A hissing sound --- white noise?"

"Almost anything could be white noise. Describe it with more detail than that."

"There's...a low rumble, a bit of a swishing sound..."

"Good. We are running on the electric motors, underwater, at a modest speed. That is what it sounds like when the boat is moving while submerged. Later, when we are near the surface with the diesel engines running, it will be a lot louder and you will not be able to hear much in the water beyond the engines. But while we are on the electric motors, we can hear more on sonar. 

"Sonar requires imagination," Hemi continued. "You have to put your mind out there in the water. When you hear a sound, you have to match it to an image in your head that shows how the sound could be made. The more detail you can imagine to fit it to the sound, the more accurate your assessment of the contact will be. That is what makes a top sonar person." 

Hemi pointed to the largest of a set of gauges further up the sonar unit in front of them.

"Now, the gauge above the directional indicator is the main signal strength indicator. All those smaller gauges above it show signal strength at different frequencies, but you only need to worry about this main signal strength indicator for now. Watch that needle. If you see it jump, there is a significant sound out there in the water, and you will want to focus on it, listen to it, and try to figure out what it is. 

"Let us see..." Hemi turned the direction dial slowly. About a quarter of the way around, the strength indicator dial moved up a little and wavered there. "So, see by the needle that there is something to hear in this direction? What do you hear in your headset now?"

Cassandra listened, her eyes watching the signal strength indicator needle wavering like a hummingbird feeding. It was moving in response to another kind of white noise, higher pitched than the sub's engines, which she could still hear rumbling in the lower frequencies. This sound was familiar, a washing, churning sound with an occasional rumble mixed in... She smiled. "It's breaking surf, isn't it?"

"Correct! There is a small atoll a few miles in that direction and waves are breaking on its shore. Let's see what else is out there." Around the directional needle went, and Hemi slowed it, and stopped with the strength indicator needle throbbing slightly, like it had a pulse.

[//]: # (Julia from Hagfish caught the contraction Hemi uses in the above paragraph. I think this one has to stay, it just sounds too awkward to write out Let us in this instance.)

Cassandra closed her eyes. In her headphones she could hear a distant clicking, slow and regular. The clicks had a strange kind of richness to them. They bounced around the underwater landscape, and she could hear not just the clicks but also the echoes of the clicks. The dark world out there lit up in her mind, and she remembered storybooks about sea life from not so long ago when she was a child. "Is that the sound dolphins make?"

"Very good! Dolphins use active sonar, bouncing sounds off underwater objects to locate them. They are much better at it than we are. Did you notice that you could hear the dolphins in one ear slightly before the other?"

Cassandra nodded again.

"That is because the sonar uses a couple of sets of microphones, one on the front of the boat, and one at the rear. Sound coming in hits one microphone before the other, and the sonar rig puts the difference into the earphones for you. With practice, you can use the difference in how long it takes to estimate how far away a contact is. For instance, I can tell you these dolphins are about a third of a nautical mile away. That only works if the contact is close enough that we can hear the difference, though. If you think about it: a contact that is farther away will send out a sound that will be murky enough by the time it gets to us to hit both the microphones on the bow of the _Prospect_ and the stern at basically the same time. It's not unlike the way the stars in the sky look like they are on a flat plane even though there's vast differences in the distance they might be from us." 

"OK, ya, that makes sense," said Cassandra, picturing the sound waves bouncing off the boat in her head.

Hemi smiled. "Miss Cassandra, you may have a career ahead of you. Keep practicing until we surface and we start the diesels later tonight. You will not be able to hear anything after that."

"OK, Hemi. Thanks."

Hemi left her there listening to the dolphins and climbed up next to Percy in the control room.

"How'd she do?" asked Percy.

"We may have a pair of ears yet."

"That would be a nice fucking change. Most of these meatheads are OK at rudimentary steering, but they're fuckin' useless on sonar."

[//]: # (Early-night: night 1, run to Stilt City)
A few hours later the clocks and sun charts coordinated to tell them that it was well after dark on the surface. Percy had the boat come up to periscope depth and she put the scope up to check the surface. Finding an empty black horizon in all directions, she had Gregory blow air into the main ballast tanks from the low-pressure system and raise the _Prospect_ fully up to the surface.

Percy's standard strategy for a cargo run was to stay underwater and run slow on the batteries during the day, and surface to run on the diesels at night. Running on the diesels meant moving much faster and recharging the ship's batteries at the same time. Even with all the shipping traffic these days, the oceans were still mostly huge open spaces. A submarine running with no lights on the surface at night was a dark and tiny target, unlikely to be spotted by anyone. The main risk was being tracked by radar --- on the surface they created a fairly strong radar signature. But at the same time, they ran their own radar receiver. If anyone else was tracking the _Prospect_ with radar, the _Prospect_'s crew would see the signal and know they were there, usually with plenty of time for the _Prospect_ to disappear underwater and change course.

[//]: # (Modern teardrop subs are faster under water, but WWII subs had a hull design that made them faster on the surface. The Prospect is somewhere inbetween, but without a snorkel, the designers would have planned it to be faster on the surface, where it had to be to recharge batteries.)

The only other way they might be found is if an Authority ship heard the _Prospect_'s rumbling diesels on sonar. But to do that they would have to be within ten or twenty nautical miles of the _Prospect_. Not an impossible scenario, but somewhat unlikely on any normal night of a cargo run.

Percy also always kept one more ancient backup system for spotting trouble early: she put someone up in the lookout ring with binoculars. As soon as the deck was above the surface of the water, Percy and Hemi went up through the hatch in the control room and climbed to the bridge at the top of the sail. Percy had the radar mast raised, which had two lookout rings mounted to it, one on either side, and called Owen up. As he came onto the bridge she handed him binoculars and pointed to the lookout rings. Owen kept climbing.

Percy looked at Hemi. "Be glad you don't have to do fucking lookout duty anymore."

"I am," said Hemi. "I remember it well. At night, you are just standing up there in the wind, like you are swimming through pure blackness. Your mind starts to play tricks on you when you most need to keep your mind clear. It is a young person's job."

"Reliable young people, anyway," said Percy. "Hey down there in the control room," she shouted through the hatch, "you can start the diesels."

There was a moment more of the quiet of the water sloshing down the length of the hull pushed by the electric motors before the diesels deep in the belly of the _Prospect_ hissed, coughed, and fired. Black smoke streamed out behind the sail. The vibration of the engines carried up through the deck and shook the soles of their feet.

Hemi called down to ask for their new speed and to confirm the heading. He marked the answers down carefully on his ever-present clipboard.

"I heard that some boats like the _Prospect_ are being fitted with snorkels now," said Hemi.

"That's what they're calling those masts you can raise for feeding oxygen to the diesels while underwater, right?"

[//]: # (This is less about explaining how snorkels work than about explaining to potential submarine nerds reading this book why there's no snorkel on the _Prospect_... yet.)

"Yes. The diesels exhaust out of them too. A boat with a snorkel never has to come up to the surface, you can recharge the batteries from periscope depth."

"We should look into installing one at some point. Maybe after this job. It seems like it would be worth the investment. The nighttime surface runs are starting to require too much care and caution for me to feel safe."

"The funny thing," Hemi continued, "is I also heard that a snorkeling diesel is actually louder on sonar than one running on the surface."

"You're fucking kidding?"

Hemi looked at her incredulously --- he was hardly ever kidding. "Apparently with the whole boat underwater, more of the sound of the running engines goes into the water. On the surface, some of it escapes into the air. Nobody expected that when they came up with the idea of the snorkel, but the boats out in the ocean were suddenly detectable forty miles off or so on sonar."

"So once again the newfangled technology doesn't solve a fucking problem, it just creates more fucking decisions for a captain," Percy spat.

"It is certainly not a job I would ever want. I prefer a measure of certainty in my work."

Percy lit a cheroot. Hemi looked up at the dark gray sky, mostly obscured by cloud cover.

"How's the navigation going?" Percy exhaled a long stream of smoke that was caught up by the wind and braided into the diesel exhaust behind them.

"I have been keeping very close track of our time, direction, and speed, as usual. But you know my track is only as good as guesswork can be. If these clouds break up before morning, and we get some stars, I would like to fix our position on the chart. When is the rendezvous with Shakes?"

"At dawn. It will certainly be easier if we know where we are with some precision."

"And if we can rely on Shakes to know where he is..."

[//]: # (Midnight: night 1, run to Stilt City)
The night ground on with the unvarying drone of the diesel engines always under the foot of any crew member on deck and relentlessly surrounding anyone below decks. Since the diesel engines of the _Prospect_ were just generators that created electricity to charge the batteries that powered the electric motors that actually propelled the boat, they were always run at the same optimum-efficiency speed for spinning the generators. Even when the boat changed speed, the all-consuming hum around them never changed in pitch or amplitude. For the crew at the controls, with no depth to control while they were on the surface and a steady course, there was almost nothing to do. The needles of the rows of gauges all stood steadfastly at their marks. 

Percy knew that this was the hardest part of the job --- remaining always ready to take action when there was absolutely nothing to do. The crew had to stay focused on the job during hours and hours of virtually no sensory input at all. It was far too easy to fall asleep at the controls, or let one's mind wander off to a place where everything was not just grime-coated gray-painted steel accompanied by a background of lush and never-changing noise that managed to be the exact auditory equivalent of the bland color that surrounded them.

She put the crew on rest rotations, leaving two people in the control room at all times, one on lookout, and one at the radar/sonar station. The off-duty crew were free to spend their time on deck if they wanted. But since there was little to see up there but a black horizon tapped firmly against a dark gray one, most of the crew came back down after a few minutes and ended up in their rack, sleeping. Except for Bastian: he wrapped his long thin form in an old tarp to keep the wind off and lay out on the forward deck, apparently finding sleep there as easily as a warm puppy.

[//]: # (The wrapped-in-a-tarp is a nod to my friend DH and his story of stowing away in a cargo plane with his buddy, and needing to wrap up in a tarp to keep warm.)

[//]: # (### Hemi and Cassandra in navigation talking about what it takes to be a submariner)

[//]: # (5 am: night 1, run to Stilt City)
In the very early hours of the morning, Hemi found Cassandra in the navigation and sonar compartment, listening intently to the sonar with the headphones on and her eyes closed.

Hemi tapped her on the shoulder, and she jumped a little before smiling when she saw it was him and pulling back a headphone.

"Aren't you supposed to be in your rack?" Hemi said.

"I volunteered to take two rotations in a row --- to keep the rotations even for everyone else...and since I'm new."

"Are you hearing anything?" Hemi asked.

"No. I try to imagine my mind going out into the water to listen to what's around us, but I can't get past the sound of the diesels."

"Sonar is extremely limited with the engines running. But..." Hemi flipped some filter switches on the sonar control board, and adjusted some tone dials, his big hands moving easily over the instruments. These were familiar settings he used when he was on sonar while the engines were running. "Try it like that."

Cassandra set the headphones back into their comfortable position on her ears and listened for a minute. "That's much better. It's like the engines are at least not distracting my attention." She made some notes on a pad of the settings Hemi had made.

"You are keeping an eye on radar too, right? That is actually maybe more important while we are on the surface."

"Yup. Owen showed me what to look for. The radar...has not done anything at all."

"That is good."

"I didn't realize when I agreed to come on board that this job would be so mind-numbing...and boring."

"That is what makes it so hard, and why only a certain type of person makes it as a submariner. I think on land there is something of a perception that it is this glorious job, where you are out from under the thumb of Authorities, free to pursue your own career, and helping to make world commerce go around. The people on land know it is dangerous, and that gets mixed into the legend of who a submariner is. But in reality, the people who make good submariners are the ones who can handle being in a cramped space for days on end with no changes in their environment at all and still manage to keep their mind sharp enough to snap into action when a situation presents itself. It is not a job that is an expression of physical acuity. It is a job that puts your mental toughness to the test."

"I certainly don't have much to offer in physical strength..." said Cassandra.

"People on land think it is a job for tough guys. We are always getting men looking for jobs on submarines. Men who look like, well, like me. Hefty guys with muscle. And some of those guys are fine. But Captain Percy and I have realized over the years that the mental toughness we need is not correlated to physical toughness. We hire people who we anticipate might have that mental fortitude, at least when we have an option in who we hire. We end up finding that mental toughness in all kinds of people. And it is not just me and Percy; most of the people who actually work in the submarine cargo industry these days make that quality their priority. The Authority subs are still full of big men, but the commercial subs are a pretty diverse crowd of workers."

"The depot was full of big men..."

"You know how that happens? Those men go looking for work on submarines thinking it is a good job for a strong fellow. But they find out they cannot handle the mental strain, and they wash out. They end up working the next job out from the center of what they went looking for: _servicing_ submarines instead of working on them."

 "Ah..." she said, her eyes widening as a large piece of her world that did not quite make sense before fell into place in her mind.

"Unlike work on land, there are few regulations or rules controlling our work out here. The job has pure evolutionary forces in play. The only people doing the work are the ones who _can_. Everyone else goes home, back to their Authorities, and policies, and networks of contacts. On land you get a job based on what you look like, and who you know. Out here, you get a job if you can do the job. We do not care who you know, where you came from, or what you look like."

A smile cracked across Cassandra's face. "That's why you hired me?"

"No, no, no. Captain Percy hired you because she was desperate for someone to sit on sonar. But you should know that you have just as good a chance at doing this job well as any other person. And...you have done well on your first day working."

Cassandra nodded.  "I want to learn as much as I can." She paused, thinking about her future. "What are you up to at this hour of the night, Hemi?"

[//]: # (### Taking a sighting by the stars)

"I am catching up on navigation. I have to do this every few hours. Come over here and look at the chart."

Cassandra hung the sonar headphones on the hook and joined Hemi at the navigation table. She looked at the big chart, and the dotted line marking their course from the depot island, and the little x marking their current position. "How do you know where we are?"

"Honestly, it is mostly just a guess. I keep track of our speed and direction very carefully. Then I just plot that onto the chart based on how long we have been traveling. That is called dead-reckoning. If the chart is accurate and there are not too many mitigating factors, like, say, a strong current that I cannot account for, then we know roughly where we are and that we will not run into anything."

"What happens if there is a strong current that pushes you off course and you don't realize it?"

"That is why we need to sometimes fix our position. If we pass by an island  or other feature that we see while on the surface or through the periscope, and that feature is on the chart, then we know where we are. Sometimes there are undersea features that we can hear on the sonar, or we know are there by changes we read in the gauge that measures how far down the bottom is. If those are on the chart, we can fix our position that way. Normally, we do not have to be super-precise --- the ocean is large and mostly empty water. It is also easier this early in a run --- I know exactly where we started from at the depot, so our position should not be too far off. But we need to rendezvous with Shakes at dawn, and being precise about our location will help that go more smoothly. So I am going up on the bridge to get a fix by the stars. Want to join me? If the stars are out, it might be worth the trip up the ladder."

"Is it OK for me to leave the radar?"

"Just for a few minutes. Make sure to check it as soon as you come back down."

They climbed up through the control room and up the interior ladders of the sail to the bridge. Owen was back in the lookout ring above them and greeted them when their heads shadowed the red light coming up from the open hatch, happy to have something to break the monotony of being on lookout.

Overhead the clouds had blown off leaving a clear sky that was just beginning to brighten at the horizon. But the stars above still glowed, peppering the dark field in a way that suggested forces of chaos and random malevolence far beyond human knowing, but rendered into flat plane for the comprehension of the pitiful viewer.

"Wow," said Cassandra.

"Yes, that's the mariner's privilege," said Hemi. "And the lucky submariner occasionally gets to dip in as well."

Hemi took out his sextant, clipboard, star charts, and graphs. He took sightings on three or four known stars, measuring their precise height above the horizon. He scratched a number of notes onto the clipboard with a pencil.

[//]: # (It suddenly occurs to me that a sextant is both used for a sighting of a celestial object, and giving you a siting of where you are.)

"How does that thing work?" Cassandra asked.

"This is a sextant. It measures how far above the horizon a particular star or the sun is. That will let me fix our position on the chart. If you are interested, I can train you how to use it. But not tonight."

Cassandra nodded.

"Unlike mariners, the submariner does not often have the luxury of visual references to find their place in the world," Hemi continued. "We wander under the ocean, feeling our way by sound. And every once in a while poke our head up to secure our location in the swirling mass by judging ourselves against the stars."

[//]: # (That is, most surface mariners would prefer to do a noon sighting off the sun. The submariners more often have to do a twilight sighting of stars.)

"That's poetic," said Owen, listening to their conversation from the lookout ring.

Hemi smiled. "And just a little bit of a clich√©," he said more loudly, for Owen's benefit. "I find a touch of the poetic gives some much-needed meaning to this black and gray metal world of ours. But if you let it go to your head, it could keep you from making the clear-minded assessments of situations that are necessary to remain alive as a submariner." Hemi took a sighting of another star and marked its altitude down on his clipboard. "OK, Cassandra. Back to your radar scope. I need to make some minor course adjustments in the control room."

Hemi and Cassandra climbed back down into the _Prospect_, leaving Owen alone to occupy the center point on a circular field of blackness under the half-sphere of stars that seemed on the verge of being ignited by the fires below the horizon.

Bastian had taken over the lookout ring from Owen by the time the sky lightened enough in the east to gray out the stars in that direction and create an echo of light on the black disk of the ocean. When Bastian could see the bow of the boat in the gloom in front of him, he climbed down to the bridge and, cupping one hand around his mouth, shouted down to the control room that it might be time to dive.

Percy climbed up to join Bastian on the bridge and looked around for a few minutes. She took some long breaths --- the last of the fresh air before the next twelve hours or so below deck --- and then told Bastian to follow her back down into the sub.

[//]: # (------ FEB 2025 EDITED TO HERE; use :WF and pablo in console, desert, shine and moria, or paper in gvim ------)
 
They buttoned up the _Prospect_ and, when all the hatches showed green lights on the board in the control room, they shut down the diesels and dove the boat to fifty meters. After fixing their position earlier in the evening, Hemi slept his three hours, and then returned immediately to the control room. Now that they were submerged again, he wanted to take the boat in a new direction as a precaution against the small chance that anyone had been tracking their course on the surface without their awareness. With the cargo they were hauling, Hemi felt there was no reason not to use every stealth maneuver they had.

After they had leveled off, he had them bring the boat hard about to starboard. This was backtracking a bit, but they were now aimed directly at the rendezvous point for the _Gnat_, which they would reach in another two hours at their current speed.

Those two hours remained nearly silent and uneventful. Everyone had low early-morning energy and no one felt like much of a conversationalist after a long night with short sleep. Though the social situation was improved by Gregory bringing up the first pot of coffee and passing around tin mugs to the crew in the sonar compartment and the control room.

They cruised to the rendezvous point, and then came up to thirty meters of depth. They shut down the electric motors entirely, and Hemi trimmed the boat until it sat hovering perfectly still and silent in the water.

Cassandra was just waking up from her sleep rotation, and groggily making her way from the crew quarters to the sonar compartment where she found Hemi. He handed her a tin cup full of sweetened black coffee.

[//]: # (Early morning: day 2, run to Stilt City)
"Time to get back on sonar Cassandra. We have reached the spot where we are supposed to rendezvous with Shakes. I need you to listen for his boat. It is quite a small boat, so it may be challenging to hear. But since we have got the _Prospect_ completely shut down you will have total silence. If you hear Shakes --- or anything else in the water --- come get me. I will be in the galley. The rest of the crew is going on break while there is nothing to do, so it is all you right now."

"That makes this sound important... You trust me with this?"

"It is good practice for you, and the worst that could happen is you miss him and we are a little delayed in the rendezvous. I would be happier if we got moving again soon though, so...try not to miss him if he goes past."

"OK, Hemi." Cassandra sat down at the sonar rig, put the headphones on, and took a sip of her coffee before passing the mics around in a full circle to get settled and oriented.

Hemi went off to the galley with his clipboard and notes, and the rest of the crew hit the racks to catch up on much-needed sleep. The _Prospect_ was left dark and absolutely silent.

Cassandra turned the directional control of the mics slowly around. She completed another full circle, and then came back the other way. Her eyes closed and she could see the sounds in the water coming towards the _Prospect_. The water had slightly different qualities in different directions, so after a few times around she could tell generally which way the microphones were pointing without looking at the directional indicator. When they were forward towards the bow, she could hear the bilge water sloshing in the lowest parts of the ship. Towards the stern, she could hear clearly without the annoying interruption of the propeller sound that was always in that direction while the electric motors were running.

The _Prospect_ was currently at its absolute maximum sonar listening capacity, but there was nothing out there. The ocean was completely empty in every direction. Cassandra focused her mind and kept it out in the water. Every time she felt some subject other than sonar intruding on her consciousness, she took a deep breath and forced her mind back out into the water. 

It was incredibly tiring work.

Two hours later, there had still been no sign of Shakes. Percy could never sleep for long, and so was soon back in the control room with a cup of coffee from the galley, smoking and making small adjustments to the trim of the boat. Each of these adjustments was accompanied by a brief rush of water or air through the piping of the ship. And each time this happened Cassandra got completely distracted for a few frustrating moments. Cassandra did not yet realize that the sonar operator could, in some instances, have some authority over even the captain on a submarine and request silence be maintained.

[//]: # (Mid-morning: day 2, run to Stilt City)
Another hour went by. Cassandra thought she was starting to crack. She considered asking Hemi to take over. She was worried that somehow Shakes had sneaked past her in his little sub. That she had missed him and screwed up her first real job. Rationally, she knew that was unlikely though. She pushed herself to keep listening to the silence.

Then, far off their port side, she heard an engine in the water. It was not like the other sea craft she had heard thus far in her limited experience on sonar. It had a continuous popping sound, like a machine gun being fired off in the distance, accompanied by a low-frequency roar.

"Captain Percy!" Cassandra called up to the control room where Percy still sat fiddling with the controls to her boat. "I hear something."

Percy slid down the ladder and picked up the second sonar headset and put it on. Cassandra rolled the mics back and forth across the direction of the contact, and settled them in on the strongest signal.

"Is that Captain Shakes?" Cassandra asked doubtfully.

"That can't be fucking Shakes. It sounds like a supertanker or an aircraft carrier or something. Go get Hemi. I think he should hear this."

Cassandra went off to the galley, leaving Percy listening to the contact. She came back with Hemi, who held a tin cup with the dregs of cold coffee in the bottom. He slipped the headphones on and stood there, his coffee cup tilting around his fingers, staring at the gauges on the sonar and watching them bobble up and down. He flipped some filters on and listened again.

"Well," Hemi said, "that is strange. It does sound like a tanker or something big just from sheer volume. But it is moving very fast, too fast for a big ship..." He paused listening again. "It is closer now, and I can hear the prop revolutions... The frequencies are all wrong. The prop is spinning too fast, and sounds small, not like a big ship screw."

"Shakes was planning to modify the _Gnat_ to be louder --- you think that could be what his boat sounds like now?" Percy asked.

"If that is Shakes, the job has been overdone..."

"Really? You think it's fuckin' possible _Shakes_ overdid it, do you?" Percy rolled her eyes. "Maybe instead of the sound of the _Gnat_ masquerading for the _Prospect_, the _Gnat_ will just drown out _everything_ in a ten-mile radius."

"I just..." Hemi started, "just cannot believe that such a small boat could..." he paused listening again. "No, I am more sure of it now. The more detail I can hear, the more it makes sense that it is a very, _very_ loud, small boat, not a big ship. Though he does have it tuned so low that from a distance anyone who is not skilled on sonar might easily be fooled into thinking the contact is displacing an enormous amount of water. Good job with the identification, Cassandra."

Cassandra held onto a large and genuine smile.

"OK then. So now what do we do?" asked Percy. "If we were on the surface, I'd try to raise him on the radio. But I arranged with Shakes to rendezvous at depth, so no one sees us. I'd hate to blow our cover by surfacing now."

"I do not know," said Hemi. "The contact is well out of range of ship-to-ship. I would guess something like still twenty nautical miles off or so. We could hit it with active."

"If it turns out you're wrong and the contact is actually that sub with the ram tearing its way towards us, then an active ping will be like knocking on their hatch and telling them exactly where we are." Percy paused. "We have the advantage of being completely hidden at the moment. I hate to just hand that away."

Hemi shrugged. "That is why I leave the decision to you."

Percy considered her options. "You are fairly certain it's Shakes?" she asked Hemi.

"I am fairly certain that contact is not the big ship it initially sounded like," said Hemi.

"Fuck it. Ping it."

"OK. Cassandra, remember I mentioned 'active' sonar during your training session? I am going to use that now. Follow what I do." He powered up the active sonar unit. "Passive sonar is like listening quietly in a dark room to figure out where other people might be standing. Active sonar is like quickly turning a bright light on and then off again so you can see the exact location of the people in the room. The principles behind it are much more sophisticated than passive. But it is easy enough to operate." He set the direction indicator to point towards the contact. "Push the PING button, Cassandra."

She held her small finger out flat, so as not to let her long fingernail get in the way, and crushed the button home. Even without the sonar headsets they could hear the smooth round ringing sound of the ping echo through the hull and spread out into the water around them. A few seconds later the active unit calculated and displayed the range and direction to the contact.

"The active sonar figures out precisely where your contact is by calculating how long it takes for that ping sound to bounce back from the target," Hemi said, pointing to the readout on the active sonar unit. "That is useful if you have to do something like aim and fire a torpedo. But since the _Prospect_ does not have torpedoes, we do not often have reason to use it."

"The active ping also tells the target exactly where _we_ are," added Percy. "Normally, we would not want to do that --- never use the active sonar without an explicit instruction from me or Hemi --- but assuming this contact _is_ Shakes...," she looked at Hemi, "then we just deliberately let them know exactly where we are by hitting them with that active ping."

"We shall see what the contact does now," said Hemi, putting the sonar headset back on.

Within a minute of the _Prospect_'s ping, the contact went silent.

"They're gone?" Cassandra asked, still listening to the other headset.

"They have shut down their engine," Hemi said, "which does not tell us anything."

"Well, how the fuck were they supposed to respond?" Percy asked Hemi. 

"Can he just ping us back?" asked Cassandra.

"I am not sure the _Gnat_ has an active sonar system like that," said Hemi. "We could ping them again? It would let them know we are not going anywhere." He looked over at Percy.

"And then what? What's the full fuckin' plan here Hemi?" she asked.

"Well, without surfacing, I think we wait until he moves into ship-to-ship range. Then we can confirm it is Shakes over ship-to-ship radio."

"A quarter of a nautical mile? If it's someone who wants to do unpleasant things to us instead of Shakes, that's awfully fucking close."

"If they want to do unpleasant things, they are likely to begin long before reaching ship-to-ship range," said Hemi. "I advise we ping them again. If the contact does anything that seems suspicious, we will move off from this spot --- quietly."

"...Alright," said Percy. "Fuckin' ping 'em again. What do I care, it's just my boat and all our lives."

Hemi caught Cassandra's eye and pointed to the PING button. She reached out and pressed it again. Another resonant ping left the _Prospect_ and soared through the water. The range and direction displayed on the active sonar unit.

"See, Cassandra, it was like they were invisible while they were being silent, but bouncing the ping off them let us know they are still there. ...And they know we are still here."

Cassandra nodded with one hand on an earpiece. She listened quietly for a minute. Then: "I think I hear something."

Hemi listened closely. "OK, the contact is running on electric motor now. And I can tell by the pitch that it's definitely a small craft moving quickly... towards us." Hemi listened for a moment longer. "It is definitely the _Gnat_, I recognize it now."

"Thank fuckin' hell," said Percy. "That was ridiculous, Hemi. We've got to work out a better way of communicating with the _Gnat_ if we're going to keep working with that guy. We can't be pinging every tanker that goes over us hoping it's actually our tiny submarine friend."

"I'll talk to Shakes about it when we get him on board," said Hemi.

[//]: # (### Rendezvous with the Gnat)

Within an hour, Shakes's voice lit up the ship-to-ship radio in the control room. *"Break. Break. This is the mighty _Gnat_. Were those fuckin' ear-splitting pings coming from the folks I'm looking for?"*

Hemi climbed the ladder to the control room and took the mic from the overhead radio. "Indeed, _Gnat_. This is the _Prospect_ and we are glad to know now that we were not pinging an Authority battleship."

*"Ah,"* said Shakes, *"so my subterfugal modifications were effective? Wait till you see what I fuckin' did, Hemi. You're going to love it."*

Hemi smiled into the mic. "Sounds good, Captain Shakes. You did not break off your mating collar while making those modifications, did you?"

*"Nope. It's still riding with fucking pride atop the _Gnat_'s sail. Mating with the _Prospect_ should be at least as smooth as last time."*

"I hope it does not go that badly," said Hemi. "OK, we will put the _Prospect_ in gear, and drive forward slowly. Just like last time, you can come up underneath, and put the _Gnat_ on the mating collar."

*"Roger that. But...you're going to have to come up shallower. I might have more confidence than I used to, but I still don't want to push the _Gnat_ as deep as you are now if I don't fuckin' hafta."*

Percy had been listening to the conversation from below at the navigation station. Now she climbed up to the control room to sort out the details of this maneuver with Hemi. 

Hemi caught her eye while she was still on the ladder. "Shakes needs us to come shallow."

"How shallow? I'd prefer to keep her as deep as possible."

"I believe the _Gnat_'s maximum depth was around thirty meters --- according to Shakes's estimate, which was unchallenged by anything like an engineering background."

"Can we do it with the _Prospect_ at twenty meters?" she asked.

"I suspect so, that's about how deep we had it at the depot." Hemi thumbed the mic on the ship-to-ship. "Captain Shakes, what if we make the _Prospect_'s keel twenty meters down. Can you do the mating at that depth?"

*"Surely,"* Shakes voice crackled in reply. *"But remember that while the _Gnat_ is attached, you can _not_ go any fucking deeper. Beyond 30 meters or so and you'll crush the _Gnat_ and, you know, probably flood the fuckin' _Prospect_ as well --- not that I'll be giving two shits about your ugly barge after you beer-canned my baby."*

"I got you, Captain Shakes. Twenty meters maximum depth it is."

[//]: # (### Shakes back on board; explanation of his escape from the depot; his modifications to make the _Gnat_ louder; his introduction of Herschel the pigeon.)

They carried out the maneuver without incident. Shakes brought the _Gnat_ up under the _Prospect_ and connected to the mating collar. When he popped the hatch, Chips was there waiting for him, just like last time.

"Ah, fuck-ya, Captain Shakes. At least I didn't have to weld your fuckin' boat back together to get ya on board this fuckin' time."

"Good to see you again too, Chips. I'll have you know my boat has been adjusted and tuned to an absolute precision-meister's peak of fuckin' performance. The _Gnat_ is now faster, more maneuverable, and louder than any other boat of its size and displacement."

"Ah, yer the first fucker I've ever fucking met who is proud to have a loud fucking submarine, Captain Shakes."

They made their way up to the galley, where Chips parted with Shakes to continue working on the efficiencies of her own engines in the engine room. Shakes poured some stale coffee from the pot into a mug and sat down. 

Hemi and Percy joined Shakes in the galley as soon as they had the _Prospect_ settled back on course, leaving Gregory and Bastian at the controls. The boat would spend the remaining hours of daylight running underwater. Hemi did not neglect to warn Gregory to keep a close eye on the depth and ballast control panel and not let the boat dive any deeper than they already were while the _Gnat_ was attached.

"So, Captain Shakes," said Percy, settling next to him with her own stale cup of coffee, "you made it out of the depot without causing a problem?"

"Well... there was in fact a little fuckin'... drama. I'm sure you heard some of it."

"We got a tip to leave before anything very dramatic happened," said Hemi.

"So I gathered from your note, Captain Percy. Unfortunately, I was in the middle of some work on the _Gnat_ when I got that note, otherwise I would have left right then myself. The _Gnat_'s engine was in fuckin' pieces --- I was putting a new exhaust in that I got in a deal in one of the parts shops on the exchange floor after I had got my cargo transshipped. So I was stuck on the dock when that fuckin' Authority sub arrived."

"What sub? Was it the sub with the ram?" Hemi asked.

"Well, I couldn't very well see whether it had a ram from inside the docking bay, could I? But I heard the name of the boat was the _Grackle_, that mean anything to y'all?"

"From the Northern Points Authority?" asked Percy.

"That's what the dock workers told me. How did you know that?"

"Miss Mai, who gave us this job, suggested that might be the identity of the sub with the ram."

"What did you do to the Northern Points that would send them after you?"

"Nothing! Fuckin' nothing. I've never been there. Miss Mai suggests larger shifts happening in the world that could affect our innocent little business here, and the _Grackle_ may be a symptom of those global-scale changes," said Percy.

"Well then. That boat docked and unloaded a bunch of big fucking goons. Bigger even than those who worked at the depot. Or, better fuckin' armed and armored at least. The goons tore through the whole fuckin' depot checking papers at every slip with a sub docked, questioning every person they saw in the docking bay."

"Including you?" Percy asked.

"Including me. That was no trouble, I've got quality fucking papers and stories to put off any Authority inspection long enough for me to tiptoe away. But here's a thing: they was specifically asking about your boat."

"They asked about the _Prospect_ --- by name?" Percy was horrified that any Authority would know the name of her boat at all, never mind go around asking about it.

"Indeed. A couple of those goons stood over the slip to the _Gnat_ and asked me if I knew anything about a boat named the _Prospect_: small lady captain, big fuckin' first mate."

"I assume you did not have any further information for them?" Hemi asked.

"Of course fuckin' not. But that didn't matter. By the time they got far enough down the dock to talk to me it was just perfunctory-like questioning. They had already found out from other sub crews that you had definitely been there... And that you left with a load of magnetic warheads."

"They asked you about our fucking cargo too, eh?" said Percy.

"Ya. Fortunately, they didn't seem to know anything about me coming in with you. I guess the other sub crews were afraid enough of Authority goons with guns to give up someone who isn't around, but aren't such cowards as to go so far as pointing at someone they can actually fuckin' see in the same space."

Hemi picked up a spoon and stirred his coffee. 

Percy lit a cheroot. "Shit," she said, "if they know we've got what-could-be-considered-by-certain-parties-as weapons parts on board, seems like they could take that as a fuckin' license to shoot to sink if they find us, rather than merely demanding we surface for an inspection."

"Oh," said Shakes after a pause, "I didn't tell you the best fuckin' part yet... So, after they finish questioning me, I discreetly --- and as quickly as I could --- started prepping the _Gnat_ to leave. And as I'm on the dock getting some cans of food to load into the hold, I see the commander of the Authority sub climb up out of their sub at the slip they had commandeered --- the commander is a real round guy, he wears an Authority uniform with all the trimmings --- it looks as if he wears his full fucking dress uniform every day on board the sub! He takes a squad of goons --- maybe twenty of the fuckers --- and they go up the dock and out towards the exchange floor.

"Here's the good fucking part: while he's up there on the exchange floor, the watertight bulkhead between the docking bay and the upper levels goes into an emergency-close procedure. You know, the whole shebang --- the klaxon is blaring, the red lights are spinning. The fucking Authority goons start running around in a panic, probably most of them think the docking bay is flooding. Hell, I thought that myself for a minute."

"Fuckin' wow," said Percy, half-grinning as she exhaled smoke.

"Fuck yeah. But it doesn't take long for the goons to figure out that the docking bay _isn't_ flooding --- someone had just triggered the big watertight bulkhead to close just to fuck with all these Authority toughs. The meat shields weren't much less panicked at that though --- because half their fuckin' muscle and their fuckin' commander were now separated from them by half a meter of air-tight steel doors!

"So I wasn't going to miss this wonderful opportunity of confusion --- I dumped whatever I could find laying around on the dock down into the _Gnat_, buttoned the boat up, and took the fuck off right then. Ran on battery as far as I could, then put the rest of the exhaust back together. Fortunately the diesel fired up no fucking problem and I made my way here."

"Hmm," said Hemi. "Who do you suppose was willing to anger them further by closing the watertight bulkhead?"

"My guess," said Shakes, "is that it was that dock boss lady. She was the first one the Authority goons questioned, of course, and she didn't look very fuckin' happy about it afterwards."

"Tough as she looks, I guess," said Percy.

"That watertight bulkhead did not seem like the kind of thing that was opened and closed at the drop of a fuckin' hat," said Shakes. "I suspect it delayed that Authority sub leaving by a couple of hours, all told. I'm not sure I could have gotten the _Gnat_ away --- presumably unnoticed --- without that bit of fuckin' luck."

"Which brings up another thing I wanted to ask you about, Captain Shakes," said Hemi. "That boat of yours is now certainly...loud."

"Fuck yeah! I told you I put in a new exhaust. Straight pipe. Wedged it right up against the hull so the sound goes direct out into the fuckin' water. I also tuned it for power and made some adjustments to the gearbox. The _Gnat_'s diesel now puts out far more torque than just about any other boat of its fuckin' size, I'd say. And that torque is converted to unbelievably fast prop speeds."

"And a fast prop and new exhaust mean exceptional noise," said Hemi.

"I'd say just about the loudest sub in the fuckin' water!" said Shakes proudly. "'Cept maybe some of those old coastal tug subs. That was the fuckin' plan, right Captain Percy? The _Gnat_ runs loud and fast interference for the _Prospect_."

"Yes," said Percy, "though I was sort of expecting we could make the _Gnat_ sound like another big submarine, not an ocean liner."

"The fuckin' louder, the fuckin' better, I fuckin' figured," said Shakes, popping a wad of dried green leaves into his cheek. "Oh! I almost forgot: the other modification I made to the _Gnat_ --- I got a fuckin' pigeon."

"A pigeon?" asked Hemi. "I have never heard of that. Some new kind of sonar unit?"

"No, no, like an _actual_ fuckin' pigeon-bird. A homing pigeon. Goes by the name of Herschel."

"Oh, so you got a pet..." said Percy, "to keep you company during those long hours alone aboard the _Gnat_. To keep you from going crazy...er?"

"Naw, Herschel's not a pet, I told ya --- he's a fuckin' upgrade to the _Gnat_! See I got him from a guy on the dock. He's specially trained to look for his home roost on a submarine on the surface of the ocean. His roost is on the _Gnat_ now, and I've been taking care of him. Soon he'll realize the _Gnat_ is his home. Then I just give him to you guys, and when you need me, you can send Herschel out to find the _Gnat_ with a message tied to his leg."

"Umm. Why would we use a pigeon instead of, say, the radio?"

"Well, I realized that with the modifications I was making to the engine, the _Gnat_ is now so loud inside that I can't hear the radio while the diesel is running. I needed another way to communicate with you guys, and Herschel seemed perfect. Messages by pigeon are also more secure than radio."

"A pigeon..." said Percy. "Seems fuckin' ridiculous to me."

"Sylvia, this pigeon goes a long way towards addressing the problem we had with communicating with Shakes. You asked me to talk with him about that, and here is an answer...maybe not a great answer, but I think Herschel could work. If we could just figure out how we could launch him from the _Prospect_ while we are submerged, he would be a perfect communication medium..." Hemi trailed off, envisioning some kind of pigeon buoy they could release at depth.

Percy rolled her eyes. "Whatever. Don't ever say I'm a captain who isn't willing to give new technology a fucking try. We'll take the pigeon aboard as our eighth crew member on a trial basis. Captain Shakes: how about a meal?"

"Sounds good. But I need to take a shit first. Where's the head on this boat?"

"You haven't used the _Prospect_'s head yet?"

"Naw. I prefer to waft my bum in the fortifying fresh air of the surface, if that's an option. But seeing as we're under right now..."

"It's on the middle deck, aft of the crew quarters. Be careful. Make sure you read all the instructions. It's fucking complicated."

"Aye, it's been a while since I used the fuckin' head on a sub. I sank the last sub I took a shit on."

Percy decided to assume he was joking.

[//]: # (### They eat a meal; salmon can conversation)

Percy called Gregory down from the control room and sent Owen up to relieve him. Shakes soon joined them in the galley and scrubbed his grimy hands with salt-water soap and water from the sink's sea-water tap. 

Gregory fired up the cooking range and soon had canned salmon simmering in a slightly sweet dark sauce with bits of ginger in it. He put a big pot of rice on to steam.

"That smells fuckin' astonishing, Gregory," Shakes said. "I eat that canned salmon all the time when I'm on the _Gnat_ --- usually just cold and straight from the can, though."

"That's...pretty fucking foul, Captain Shakes," said Gregory from the range, stirring his bits of fish around.

"You know, I always wondered why those salmon cans are tapered like that. Why don't they just run straight fucking up and down, like all the other cans?"

"Actually, now that you mention it, Captain Shakes, I always thought that was unusual myself. There has to be three hundred cans in the galley, and all of them are perfect cylinders except for the fuckin' salmon."

"I wish all cans were tapered," said Shakes. "Sometimes I knock a stack of cans over on the _Gnat_ and the regular ones will run off under some piece of equipment. I'm pretty fucking sure there's some cans in the bottom of the boat that rolled there years ago and I never saw again. But the taper on the salmon cans makes 'em roll around in a tight circle. They stay roughly where they fall no matter what the boat is doing and I can pick them right up before they get lost."

"Maybe salmon manufacturers know mariners and submariners have a lot of salmon on board, and they shape them like that so our seagoing friends don't lose their precious cans in the corners of ships," Gregory suggested.

[//]: # (This brilliant, but incorrect, idea comes from my friend Andrew Berman.)

Hemi chuckled. "If you want to know the real reason, it is because the salmon canneries are all in remote parts of the North. The cans are shipped up there empty to be filled with fresh-caught northern salmon. The tapered cans let them stack far more cans into the hold of ships, moving the empty cans by nesting them."

"Oh," said Shakes, sounding somewhat disappointed.

In another twenty minutes or so Gregory had steaming piles of rice on their plates smothered in bits of fish and ginger. He stir-fried a couple of boxes of frozen spinach and scooped them onto their plates to supplement the black and white mush with some dark green.

Percy called the rest of the crew in to eat in rotations that always kept one person in the control room and another listening to sonar. Shakes, as usual, ate twice again as much as anyone else. 

"Sweet fuck," he said, "if you keep feeding me food I want to eat instead of forcing myself to eat cold shit from cans, I'm going to get fucking fat." He reclined in his chair, unbuckled his belt, and closed his eyes.

"Nothing stopping you from equipping your boat with a hot plate, Captain Shakes," said Gregory.

Shakes waved his hand in Gregory's direction lazily without opening his eyes.

"Shakes, when you regain yourself from your crapulence," said Hemi, "join me at the navigation station. I want to make sure you understand our plan for this run."

Shakes nodded sleepily as Hemi and Percy headed up to the navigation and sonar compartment.

"It's probably time for more coffee," said Gregory, reaching for the pot where the dregs of the previous batch slowly embalmed a permanent black-brown stain on the bottom.

[//]: # (### Planning the run with Shakes)

[//]: # (Midday: day 2, run to Stilt City)
Shakes joined Hemi and Percy at the navigation table a short while later, somewhat revived by Gregory's coffee, and carrying two more tin mugs for Hemi and Percy, which they received gratefully.

"Here's what we're thinking, Captain Shakes," said Percy. "We're well fucking into Consolidated States's waters now. I think trouble from them is unlikely."

Shakes nodded.

Percy placed a steel straight-edge dappled with rust patches down on the chart, which showed their proposed course in a hashed line of grease-pencil marks. "Barring any unforeseen distractions, this is our planned course. We will be heading into an area that a number of Territorial Authorities claim control over."

Shakes reached into his denim vest and withdrew a small pencil and a notebook covered with black and smudged fingerprints. He began to scratch down notes in a fast, unreadable scribble.

"That's unfortunate, but fucking unavoidable, since we're heading for the mainland port of Stilt City," said Percy.

"...The locals do not call it that," put in Hemi.

[//]: # (Stilt City is a white-people name for a city with a large indigenous population. The moniker fits so well that no matter what effort the natives of the city put in to have their city addressed by its actual name, the rest of the world can not help but know it by anything other than Stilt City. This, of course, leaves the city vague and unspecified as a city in the real world in this story. It also has a pleasant dream-like quality.)

Percy waved him off. "We estimate it will take three or four days and nights to get there. That's running slow and deep during the day, and fast on the surface at night, with all things fuckin' nominal."

[//]: # (What does nominal mean? Who knows. Could mean anything really. Look it up.)

"And what's the plan for the _Gnat_?" Shakes asked.

"Generally, we'll have you run on the surface during the day. You can shut down the diesel maybe once an hour or so, and we'll check in on ship-to-ship."

"That will also give us a chance to listen for any contacts without being swamped out by the noise of your boat," added Hemi.

"At night, the _Gnat_ is less useful as a decoy, since the _Prospect_ will be on the surface anyway. I think then you can mate up the _Gnat_ and get a meal aboard the _Prospect_ and some sleep --- at least for a few hours each night."

Shakes grinned at the thought of hot meals. "What happens if someone comes the fuck up on us in the night?"

"Well, we'll emergency dive to periscope depth, drag you out of your bunk and throw you into your boat, and make sure the _Gnat_ is off before we do a further evasive deep dive. I hate the delay getting the _Gnat_ disconnected will cause, but I'd hate to deprive you of your fuckin' precious hot meals."

Shakes grinned. "No fucking doubt! Just don't panic in the heat of the moment and forget that if you dive too deep with the _Gnat_ attached, I'll have a bunch of wet scrap metal instead of a boat hanging off the bottom of this rusting fat cigar." He scribbled a few notes. "What about the _Grackle_ and those fuckin' guys who were after you? What if they are still following you?"

"I figure since we're well into another Authority's territory now, it's unlikely they are still coming after us. It's one thing to raid a depot just on the other side of an Authority line. It's another to pursue an unarmed cargo sub across the middle of another Authority's area of control. Having said that, did you get any sense while you were at the depot that they knew our destination?"

"I have no idea," said Shakes. "It entirely depends on who they talked to while they were up on the exchange level. I didn't get to see any of that."

Percy nodded.

"What about Herschel?" asked Hemi. "When will he be ready to come aboard the _Prospect_? The _Gnat_ could potentially be a long way off pretty quickly if we get into this situation where you are leading a contact away from the _Prospect_'s location. It would be nice to have Herschel ready to go find you, if that happens."

"Is that what you are really thinking, Hemi?" Percy asked with a grin. "Or are you just looking forward to having a fuckin' fluffy new crew member to take care of?"

"I'm hoping Herschel is acclimated to the _Gnat_ in another day or two. Then we can move him aboard the _Prospect_," said Shakes.

"Alright," said Percy, "bring the fucking pigeon over whenever you are ready, Captain Shakes. And Hemi, don't forget to fill in the rest of the crew on why there's suddenly going to be birdshit everywhere. But for right now, let's get the _Gnat_ running up on the surface, and get the _Prospect_ further down. I don't like being this shallow during the day."

Shakes gave a fake salute and went rearward toward the galley to take a refill of coffee with him. He then climbed downward to the deepest part of the _Prospect_, and then even lower to get back aboard the _Gnat_. 

With the _Gnat_ off and surfaced, the _Prospect_ dove down to one hundred meters. Percy was more comfortable with a heavier cover of ocean above her.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### Uneventful run through the day and the night)

The rest of the day went as planned. The _Prospect_ moved slowly and silently through the deep, while the _Gnat_ ran just at the surface, its diesel emitting a long brown shit-string of exhaust into the clear ocean air. Shakes had to keep the throttle back on the _Gnat_ to keep pace with the much slower _Prospect_. At that slower speed, the _Gnat_ was not obtrusively loud, about the same as an average surface cargo ship. That was to their benefit because Authority enforcement craft were less likely to pursue a target that sounded like a cargo ship --- at least during the day --- since anything on the surface was likely to be moving with the full blessing of the Authority.

Shakes shut down the _Gnat_'s diesel once every hour or so and checked in over the ship-to-ship. He had nothing to report but clear weather, modest swells, and open ocean. A white ball of sun pushed its way slowly across a flat white sky, and the two boats droned their way across the curve of the globe. The only thing that changed with the passing time was the sun's slow fall to the horizon. Shakes had the hatch of the _Gnat_ open and he watched the sun swell up all orange and bloated as it bounced on the perfectly flat table-top off in the west, like it was going to expel a flatulent burst of world-ending fire over the surface of the planet before it was snuffed out by the force of night pressing down on it.

[//]: # (night 2, run to Stilt City)

The dark spread slowly from behind, catching up to and overtaking the _Gnat_. When it did, Percy raised the _Prospect_ to the surface and began night crew rotations, with someone always on the radar and someone always in the lookout ring. A filet knife of a moon came up behind a thick, oppressive haze, its sharp points dulled as if they had been poked one too many times through a heavy fabric or leather. 

Shakes ran the _Gnat_ off at some distance for the first half of the night, and then dove and brought it under to mate with the _Prospect_. This dramatically slowed the _Prospect_'s speed, but Percy figured this was worth the trade-off of keeping Shakes alert and relatively sane during the day by giving him a chance to sleep while they kept moving. He came on board and ate a couple of large bowls of a hot brown soup Gregory had left simmering on the range, accompanied by thick slices of a stale and grainy bread which Shakes would cover in butter and soak in the soup until each bite softened. He slept for a few hours in one of the _Prospect_'s padded racks. As the sky lightened in the east, Percy woke him and told him it was time to get the _Gnat_ off.

[//]: # (### Herschel comes aboard the _Prospect_ for the first time.)

[//]: # (Morning: day 3, run to Stilt City)
Shakes stumbled to the galley to pick up his morning coffee. There he found Hemi who accompanied him down to the open hatch leading to the _Gnat_. Shakes disappeared through that hatch and returned holding a small wire cage with a splotchy gray bird. Herschel was sleek and trim, with an unmistakable intelligence to the eyes.

"Fuckin' Hemi, meet fuckin' Herschel," said Shakes holding the cage up for Hemi to take while he climbed up out of the _Gnat_.

Hemi poked a thick finger between the bars and rubbed Herschel's head gently. "Captain Shakes, this bird looks perhaps smarter than me, or yourself."

"Maybe you should hire him to drive the fuckin' _Gnat_ for you," said Shakes.

"Is this cage not too small for him?"

"That's just his travel cage. I have a nice comfy roost installed for him down in the _Gnat_. You don't want him to forget where his home is, otherwise he won't return there when you release him."

"Can I let him out of this cage?"

"Sure, if you --- or Percy --- don't mind a little pigeon shit around."

"I believe I shall give this fellow the run of the boat."

Shakes handed Hemi a small leather case with tiny papers and a steel band. "This is his leg band. It's pretty self-explanatory. Just write your message, attach it, and toss Herschel in the air. He'll find the _Gnat_, if it's anywhere on the surface within maybe a hundred miles or so."

"How do we get him _back_, though?" asked Hemi.

"Well..." said Shakes scratching his grimy neck with black fingernails. "It's kinda a one-fuckin'-way thing. I have to give him back to you in person. We might be able to get him to fly over to the _Prospect_ from the _Gnat_ if you were within sight...and maybe if he knew you had some food."

"I understand. It's a 'homing' pigeon. It only goes home."

"Right."

"Well, welcome aboard, Herschel. Captain Shakes, have a good run today."

"I expect to, though I'll miss having my copilot with me."
