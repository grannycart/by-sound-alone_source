They ran at full speed on the surface for the rest of the day. The fog held out, covering them with a varying but unbroken thickness for all the daylight hours. Percy put the crew on six-hour daytime rotations, despite the fact that they were moving on the surface, and they all finally managed to get some meaningful sleep. Down a crew member and with limited visibility due to the fog, Percy skipped posting a lookout. It was somewhat risky to charge ahead on the surface at full speed with no lookout, especially since the fog also played havoc with the radar. But the limitations of radar were also useful, since it would foul up anyone searching for them with radar as well. Percy kept either Cassandra or Hemi on sonar at all times, counting on them to hear another vessel above the sound of the _Prospect_'s diesels soon enough that they would be able to take action if necessary.

Even with no official lookout posted in the ring, there was almost always someone on the bridge anyway. Since the crew were free to spend their off-hours on deck, most of them chose to while away at least part of it in the open air.

[//]: # (Early-evening: night 4, run to Stilt City)
The fog lasted until dark, which was all they needed. The boat plunged into the settling darkness with the exhaust stacks streaking flames above. The fog gave way to the cooler air of night, and the _Prospect_ came out under a dome of stars. They cut their way across the surface of the planet and left behind a gash of white wake through the black water.

[//]: # (### Hemi and Chips conversation about Owen)

Hemi kept the chart accurate with their position, the dashed line straight and true and rapidly growing in the direction of the continental coast, where the chart was marred with the large black dot showing the location of Stilt City. Around nightfall they crossed out of the waters unquestionably controlled by the Consolidated States of the Archipelago Islands into the area contested by a number of different Authorities. With the fog lifted and a higher risk of Authority interference, Percy put them back on three-hour nighttime shifts and kept someone on lookout again.

[//]: # (middle-night: night 4, run to Stilt City)
Chips had spent the entire day in the deepest parts of the engine room, refusing to come up even for meals. Nobody had seen her since the late meal the night before. But with everyone taking a shift on lookout, she was now required to do her turn in the lookout ring. Hemi called for her on the PA when her shift came up in the middle part of the night, and she duly arrived in the control room on her way to the bridge a few minutes later. She climbed upwards with binoculars in hand and without a word. 

It was the darkest part of the night, so Hemi appeared on the bridge a few minutes into her watch with his sextant, intending to take star sightings and get a solid fix on their course.

Hemi looked up at Chips from the bridge. "I was not entirely sure you would show for your lookout shift."

"Have you ever known me to be anything but a fuckin' professional, Hemi? I may not be fucking happy about working on this fucking demon-driven boat, but I'm going to do the fuckin' job I was fuckin' hired to do until we hit the fuckin' dock."

"And then what?"

"As soon as this fuckin' bitch of a boat bumps, I'm stepping the fuck off. And not looking the fuck back. If you had any fuckin' sense you'd be fuckin' leaving with me. The whole fuckin' crew should be leaving with me. How many fuckin' times do I have to be fuckin' pushed right up to the fuckin' edge of the abyss for my job? How many fuckin' times do I have to look fuckin' death in his cold and ugly fuckin' face? How many times do I have to watch people I fuckin' care about fall off that abyss, Hemi?"

"What happened with Owen could not be helped, Chips. I was there. Sylvia had to make a tough choice without a clearly correct course of action, and she did. I regret what happened to Owen. I really do. But this job is dangerous, he knew that."

"Don't you fuckin' defend her with your fuckin' burden-of-command bullshit Hemi. This isn't a fuckin' war boat, it's a commercial fuckin' cargo sub. She had plenty of fuckin' choices that could have ended with Owen alive. I'm all for moving cargo under the fuckin' attention of Authorities, but not at the fuckin' cost of people's lives!

"She could have turned this fuckin' boat over to them. It's not like they would fuckin' execute us. We'd just be fucked back to land for a while. Eventually we could go the fuck back out on some other fuckin' boat --- no fuckin' shortage of need for skilled submariners. There was no fuckin' reason for anyone to die!"

"They fired at us first, Chips. Owen was probably hit in the first barrage."

"But he wasn't fuckin' dead, was he, Hemi? He was not fuckin' dead. And she fuckin' knew it --- we _all_ knew it Hemi. And as soon as we knew it, we should have aborted the fuckin' dive and saved fuckin' Owen!"

"You know she could never turn over this boat like that."

"_That_ is why that's the fuckin' _hard_ call Hemi. That's the actual fucking burden of command." Chips was breathing hard through her nostrils, barely able to keep the binoculars raised, and repeatedly interrupting her scanning arc of the horizon and beginning again. "You're guilty too, Hemi Howell. Don't fuckin' think this is all on fuckin' Percy. You could have easily aborted the dive."

Hemi looked off at the ocean. "But I did not. I made the decision I did in the moment. Aborting the dive did not even occur to me. I did what I was supposed to do as deck boss."

"And that right fuckin' there is why I'm leaving this fuckin' boat. I respect you, Hemi, and I like workin' with you. But this boat is hers, from fuckin' bridge to fuckin' keel, and she's a fuckin' stubborn piece of fuckin' dried shit the odor of which is foulin' the fuckin' air of my whole fucking life right now. Yours, too...fuck."

Hemi looked through the sextant and adjusted it with slow, smooth motions, watching the bright star in the finder fall from the sky to meet the rising black pool of the horizon line. He noted their position on his clipboard and climbed silently down off the bridge.

[//]: # (### They enter Stilt City)

[//]: # (day: day 5, run to Stilt City)
They continued to run at high speed on the surface for the rest of the night. At dawn the _Prospect_ dove, and they moved slowly under the remaining contested territory, tracing the gradual rise of the continental shelf as it approached the shore. They surfaced about midday well inside the area controlled by the Eastern Coastal Collective. That Authority aggressively defended open commerce in the waters leading into Stilt City. This police protection of free trade had led in the last twenty years to the rapid growth of what had come to be known worldwide as Stilt City. This policing was also the root cause of the heavy contesting of the waters farther out from the Collective's control.

The _Prospect_ moved into Stilt City under a high gray sky. The seas were calm and the air was warm. Percy had Hemi open the big cargo hatch on the deck and fresh air blew through it and down into even the deepest and most stagnant bilge wells of the ship.

They passed a number of Collective enforcement ships holding station in an array around the protected waters as cargo vessels made the run into the city. But, as was customary, those ships did not interfere with anyone who was not interfering with another ship. They were there to stop other Authorities from delaying or preventing cargo from moving into or out of their port. The policy here was that policing the contents of cargo boats was a matter for the Authority forces on land.

The moniker "Stilt City" might have been somewhat pejorative, but it was accurate. It was built on a vast river delta which rapidly attenuated the big ocean rollers down to calm, flat, and brown water. The structures built on pylons began to appear relatively far out into the ocean --- some in places where the water was dozens of meters deep. The buildings teetered high above the larger waves they needed to clear in those deeper waters. They stood atop artificial underwater forests of rigidly spaced trees, placed by the work of human hands. The structures farthest out from the mainland popped up in clumps in the distance on both sides of the _Prospect_. It was hard not to see them as circus performers striding around on tall stilts.

The _Prospect_ floated into the main channel that led into the city. It was nearly a mile wide for much of its passage, forming an artificial equivalent to the large river that bisects so many coastal cities. 

The rapid growth of Stilt City and large volume of trade had brought wealth in, but the wealth did not flow down to all residents. The channel was thus filled with all manner of sea craft, from enormous steel cargo ships under the flags of various Authorities to tiny canoes from which the marrow of the boat had been scraped by the application of fire and ax blade. The most common craft, of which there must have been thousands, was an angular home-built wooden boat, driven either by singular canvas sails bound taught on rough wood masts and booms, or by long thin oars that were used to row the boats in deep waters and pole the boats through shallower waters.

Virtually all the trade of Stilt City was done on the open water or on the docks. In many places, boats of all sizes were rafted up, and people traded goods across the networks of hulls.

As the _Prospect_ made its way up the main channel, more and more sea craft moved about them. Speed was reduced to three knots and they crawled along through the still murky water leaving no wake. The stillness of the surface belied the powerful slow current that carried massive amounts of freshwater far out to sea, down in the depths. 

Percy, Cassandra, and Hemi stood on the bridge. Hemi held binoculars and carefully piloted the steel bulk of the _Prospect_ among the dense traffic of small wooden craft that swarmed around them. He called maneuvers down through the hatch to Gregory and Bastian, who sat at the controls.

"So this entire place is built on stilts?" asked Cassandra.

"That's why they call it fuckin' Stilt City," said Percy.

[//]: # (This world does not deviate so much from the history of the real world that influence and names of Europe are not spread all around the globe from the impacts of the European colonial period and continued colonialism. As cool as it would be to write that book, I am not sure I could do it. See also the note about the name of Sir Piero below, which is Italian.)

"Again, 'they' does not include the people who actually live here," Hemi said. "But yes, almost all of it is on stilts above the delta waters, except for the old part of the city that clings to the dry land. Many cities around the world are built on swamps because that is where the large rivers meet the sea, and that is where major ports come together. In richer places, they drain the swamps to get to dry land under them. Here, they found it more economical to just build above the water line on stilts, at least in recent years."

"All these structures don't get washed away in storms?" Cassandra asked.

"The river delta makes the water very shallow deep into the ocean. Most of the construction is built far enough up the delta that the waves of the ocean are completely flattened. But...there are many who worry that a really big storm could wipe the entire thing out. The residents here may simply be lucky that it has not happened yet."

"Where does all the material for building come from?"

"Mostly trees are cut down on shore and then floated out. That is why nearly everything is made of wood. I think they do sometimes pull sunken waterlogged trees up from the bottom, though."

The channel began to narrow, pushing the sea craft using it together. Hemi steered the _Prospect_ to take advantage of a path carved through the smaller boats by a huge oiler making its way slowly up the channel ahead of them. On either side of the channel, the structures raised on pylons above the water grew denser. In places there were masses of small thatched-roof huts, with walls made of thin rotting wood panels and the roofs of cut and dried shore grasses. There were dozens of huts clumped together, as if they gained strength to stand on their wobbling stilts by leaning against each other. Between the clumps ran narrow channels of dark water, in many places only passable by the smallest of the vessels that traversed back and forth across Stilt City. Those narrow channels fed into slightly larger winding passages, which gave access to buildings and homes buried deep in the dense clumps of development.

Every so often, the masses of huts were broken up by a large access channel running off the main channel. Around these access channels had risen most of the commercial trade, which had led to the building of long docks and piers, more substantial warehouses, and larger buildings --- always sitting on stilts above the water. The fancier buildings had paid extra to ship out and install steel roofs. Big steel cargo and transport ships would make their way into these access channels and dock against the flimsy, leaning piers of crunching wood that barely seemed able to keep the big ships immobile, and perhaps would not have at all if the waters were not so still. The cargo was unloaded onto these docks and from there moved off to its destination by local labor: either into the warehouses, onto other cargo ships, or dispersed around Stilt City --- sometimes up onto the mainland and ground-based logistical connections.

[//]: # (### They hire Sir Piero, the pilot.)

As they pushed their way slowly up the main channel and deeper into Stilt City, Percy became a little concerned. "Hemi, do you know how to find the fuckin' dock we are supposed to unload at in all this fuckin' mess?"

"There is a system to the dock numbers," said Hemi. "I am fairly certain that we are moving in the right direction. However, the system is complex and poorly maintained. We shall have to ask for guidance at some point."

Percy asked Cassandra to use the binoculars to scout out the hand-painted signs that indicated the dock numbers accessible from each access channel they passed, and report them to Hemi. The descending order of the dock numbers reassured Percy somewhat, but she would have been much more satisfied with a quality chart of Stilt City's many passages and byways.

The open lane of the oiler in front of them made navigating much easier. The local boats generally tried to stay out of the way of the bigger ships, knowing that the big ships were far less maneuverable and took much longer to stop. But a ship making its way up the channel still had a bit of a job clearing a path, whereas few local boats would try to cut between two ships moving up the channel. 

One did though. A small flat-bottomed boat, a kind of a wherry, that moved slowly into the lane between the oiler and the _Prospect_, at such a speed that there was no chance it would make its way across the lane before the _Prospect_ was on top of the tiny craft. The man paddling the wherry kept pausing and raising one arm. At first Hemi thought he was trying to make sure the people guiding the _Prospect_ saw him, but then Hemi realized he was actually hailing them. Hemi called down through the hatch to Bastian to reverse thrust and bring the _Prospect_ to a stop. The man in the wherry angled his tiny tree of a craft alongside the huge gray metal cylinder and bumped up against the _Prospect_'s hull. He deftly grabbed the handholds on the hull as they swept past and stepped one foot up onto a rung while holding his boat still with the other. He looped a painter from the wherry around one of the step rungs so it could not get away and then shimmied up the handholds to the deck.

"'Hoy there! Do you need a pilot?" he shouted up to the bridge of the sail as he continued to move towards them. "I can bring your sub marine in to where-the-fuck-ever. I know all the ways and docks around here. I can make sure you don't ground --- the water is very suddenly shallow in many places."

Hemi waved him up the sail, and he climbed quickly and nimbly up and over the fairing to join them. He was a small, thin man. His pure white, shortly trimmed beard and hair stood out in stark contrast to his leathery skin, which all the older locals developed after spending their adult working years on the unshaded open water. He was wearing an oddly fitted and assuredly ancient three-piece wool suit into which he was sweating profusely after climbing up the sail.

"Name's Sir Piero --- pee-ahr-oh, at least that's how most off-shore folks pronounce it."

[//]: # (I renamed this dude like 4 times and finally settled on Piero. The name comes from the captain of the Andrea Doria. --- And, almost unbelievably since I had forgotten and this was not intentional: it is the contact name in the Bruce-Partington submarine plans Sherlock Holmes story, though spelled Pierrot and presumably French?)

"_Sir_ Piero?" Percy asked.

"Knighted for my prest-ee-jee-ous piloting work. Respect the title, if you please."

"Knighted by whom?" Hemi asked. Then, letting that pass, proceeded to introduce himself and the others on the bridge before outlining the issue they were facing. "We were in fact just thinking that we may need some guidance to our dock. Here is our dock number." Hemi handed over a small piece of paper with a long number broken up by dashes on it. "Can you get us there?"

The man looked it over. "Surely. That's no great fuckin' way from here."

"Have you ever piloted a submarine before, Sir Piero?" Percy asked. "It's not totally like fuckin' surface ships."

"Surely! I piloted lots of sub marines in and out." He pronounced "sub marine" like it was two separate words. "I'm a knighted pro-fessional, all manner of craft experienced. I even had a pilot's license --- back when those used to be more strictly required."

"How much money will it cost to hire you?" Hemi asked.

"Depends on what kind of money you have."

"Coin," said Percy, showing him one from her pocket.

"Ten coin. Both in and out. If you go back out today."

Hemi agreed and paid him an advance. Sir Piero made a move to go retrieve his boat, but Hemi asked Cassandra to do it while he showed Sir Piero the control room. Even though Bastian and Gregory would continue to execute the actual maneuvering operations, Hemi always thought it was good practice for a pilot to know what the control room of a boat looked like.

Sir Piero took over command of the _Prospect_. He stood on the bridge and lit a cigar that resembled a root vegetable. Chomping the torpedo between his teeth, he read the numbers of the channels and water lanes they passed by through borrowed binoculars. After a quarter mile or so he had Bastian bring the bow around, and without slowing speed --- and with a great deal of confidence --- he plunged the _Prospect_ into a narrow way that was barely wider than the beam of the ship. 

They passed along this channel for a long way, through a more residential area with densely clustered huts on either side. The gentle wake from the passing submarine washed up under and smacked against the floorboards of the huts. In some places children played, jumping from platforms in front of the huts into the thick brown water. Percy was concerned one of the children might get it into their heads that they wanted to jump onto the _Prospect_ as it passed, and certainly they were close enough that it could be done. But huge steel ships passing close by their tiny wooden homes was a daily and dull occurrence here, and none of the children showed any exceptional interest in her submarine.

Percy was beginning to find it hard to imagine how there could be a dock that could handle a ship as large as the _Prospect_ in a residential part of the city like this, and she expressed her doubts to Sir Piero.

"This is a short way," he told her. "We will come out in a larger channel soon, but it is longer around to follow that way from the main channel."

The _Prospect_, which so often felt like a small, cramped place, suddenly seemed to take on enormous proportions relative to the huts around them. The bow was the length of dozens of huts put together, and from the sail they towered over the low thatched roofs that spread out on either side in a huge field of sprouted homes. The passage they were taking, cutting through the dense huts, reminded Percy of rowing a canoe on clear paths through reed patches in a wetland.

[//]: # (### The Prospect gets stuck in shallow water)

Bastian suddenly called up from the control room with a sense of urgency. "Up on the bridge: the depth-under-keel has a warning light and is showing very shallow --- two meters."

"Umm, Sir Piero...are you sure there's enough fuckin' water here?" Percy asked him.

"Plenty of water. I have taken many ships through here."

"But subs...we draft a little fucking deeper, you know."

"Sub marines. Ya, ya."

At that moment the grounding alarm buzzed loudly in the control room. Percy flew down the ladder and stood behind Bastian, staring at the wall of gauges. The depth-under-keel gauge had a bright red light lit next to it, and the needle was hovering just off the zero pin. Percy punched the button that silenced the annoying buzz of the alarm.

"Piero!" she called up to the bridge. "There is very very little water under us!"

"It's OK!" he shouted back just as the _Prospect_ came to an abrupt stop. Even at the careful speed they had been moving at, the stop was violent enough to jolt them all forward. Empty tin coffee cups fell and clanked along the deck while clipboards fluttered through the air.

The alarm started sounding again and a second red light lit on the depth-under-keel gauge, indicating they were firmly wedged on the bottom.

"Fuck!" Percy yelled, punching the alarm-silence button a second time. "Fucking fuck! Piero, you fucking amateur, what the fuck did you do? Bastian, power down the fucking motor before we're driven permanently into the muck."

Bastian pulled the throttle back to zero. Percy could hear Hemi and Piero discussing the situation on the bridge. Piero's voice was aggravated. Hemi was speaking in his usual even tone. But Percy could not quite make out what they were saying. She climbed to the bridge.

"Captain Percy, this never happened before," Piero said as she came through the hatch. "The silt underneath sometimes moves around. This channel has always been deep enough."

"For a fucking _loaded_ submarine? Or have you just brought fucking empty transport ships through here before?" Percy was turning red.

"I'll get you off, do not worry, Captain Percy." He leaned over the hatch and cupped one small hand to the side of his mouth. "'Hoy! You at the throttle controls: reverse motor, two knots." 

"And then what? Fucking back the whole way out to the main channel? It's not like there's room to fucking turn around here."

"If we have to do that, we can," said Hemi, trying to calm the situation. "But Sir Piero pointed out we probably have some water in the main ballast and trim tanks we can blow out. If we can get the boat up even half a meter or so, we might be able to clear the silt bar."

"Fuck," said Percy as the _Prospect_ slowly reversed, stirring the water behind them and pushing it forward along the hull. It washed outwards and under the nearby huts on either side where people had realized something was amiss and had come out to the platforms in front of their homes to watch. 

One local saw a stuck ship as an opportunity and poled his rickety craft full of fish up to the side of the _Prospect_. Hemi sent Cassandra down with a few coins to buy some.

Moving backwards did get them off the bottom. As soon as Bastian reported they had some water under the keel again, they carefully forwarded the throttle to try to bring the _Prospect_ to a dead stop, but it was impossible to have that much control over such a large vessel in such a tight space. The _Prospect_ very slowly --- but with much inertia --- bumped into a cluster of huts, and the whole block of them leaned over against the push from the submarine with a sickening crack from below of the pylons supporting the huts. A surprising number of people poured out of the huts, cursing and gesturing towards the bridge of the _Prospect_ in a variety of languages. The huts were well built and the pylons held, but the residents knew from the sound that deep structural damage had been done. Hemi was cognizant of the damage done to the foundations of the huts too, so he sent Cassandra down with more coins that she distributed among the residents until the cursing had mostly petered out.

Percy just put her face into her hands, both too embarrassed and angry to look at anyone for the moment.

Piero had Gregory open the main ballast blow valves and the high-pressure air system blew out whatever water was left in the main tanks along with a lot of excess bubbles that burbled up the side of the boat to the delight of the children who were now climbing the side of the _Prospect_ and running around on the deck. Piero also had Gregory empty every trim tank the boat had, and turn on all the bilges. Long streams of foul water poured out from the side of the hull, in one case a cataract that squarely landed against the wall of a hut, and required yet another payment from Cassandra to ease the cursing.

Getting this excess water out of the boat did raise it up, though. When Bastian reported an additional meter of water under the keel, Piero had them slowly move forward again. Percy returned to the control room to watch the gauges. The _Prospect_ crept over the shallow spot with the depth-under-keel gauge lowering all the way down to the zero pin and the grounding alarm coming back on. Percy could swear she heard the bottom sloshing along the hull as her boat pushed through a soft, sucking muck. But the forward progress was not stopped this time, and they soon came over the shallow spot, and the gauge showed a clear four meters of water under them.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
 

[//]: # (### They arrive at the dock)

They had to squeeze the _Prospect_ over two more shallow spots before Sir Piero finally turned them out into a somewhat larger channel --- maybe twice the width of the _Prospect_'s beam. This channel was consistently deeper and there was more commercial traffic moving on it. Sir Piero steamed the _Prospect_ along this channel for another mile or so, picking his way through a number of places where the channel branched left or right. The structures along the channel got larger and larger, and the traffic on the water thinned out as they moved into a part of the city that had less day-to-day trading and was more focused on storage and warehouses. The structures here tended to be large flat platforms, open on the side. Some had roofs built over them and some were open to the sky as well. Some were stacked high with cargo waiting for a ship to be loaded onto, and others were cleared waiting for a loaded ship to come in. The platforms either had one side set with a row of docking pylons, or were otherwise connected to rickety piers of weathered and gray wood that extended out from the platforms into small bays that were left as open water so that bigger ships would have enough room to maneuver in them. Many of these piers had ships of various sizes moored up against them. Only a few people were about, though, since this area was far more heavily populated with cargo than people.

Finally, Sir Piero pointed to a bay ahead off the port side while looking through the binoculars. He turned the _Prospect_ into the bay, and Hemi could see through his own binoculars that the third dock in from the channel had a small hand-lettered sign matching the dock number they were looking for. As Sir Piero and Bastian worked to bring the boat alongside the dock, Hemi got on the PA and asked Chips and Gregory to meet him on the deck. The three of them brought thick docking hawsers up from the cargo hold through the big hatch and secured them to cleats on the deck. Gregory made a daring leap from the handholds on the side of the _Prospect_ to the dock over the sloshing water in the closing gap. Hemi and Chips tossed the lines over to him so he could secure them to the docking pylons.

The dock was exceedingly narrow for handling a ship of the _Prospect_'s size, maybe just two meters or so wide, and when the _Prospect_ leaned its weight up against it, the whole dock shifted its center of gravity towards the other side. The _Prospect_ took up the entire length of the dock, and then extended another quarter ship-length out beyond it into the turnaround bay. The dock was supported by ancient poles of wood, weathered to a smooth but grainy gray texture. The cross planks had many knot holes and splintered easily under scuffing feet. About halfway out, the dock widened to accommodate the base of a rusty and flimsy looking crane which was left angled at its joints in such a way that it looked like the giant crooked finger of a crone cursing the fates before her. Further out from the crane, the dock narrowed again to just enough space for an individual to walk.

The dock ran into a large and mostly empty platform. It was one of the platforms that had a roof built over it, supported on the same graying wood pylons as the dock, and roofed with roughly hewn old boards that had gaps and holes that let light, and presumably rain, pass through in many places. At the far end of the platform was a squat little cube of an office with a few stacks of crates near it, from which the business of the platform and dock was executed.

[//]: # (### Chips quits)

As soon as the lines were secured, Chips hauled two large and frayed canvas duffels containing all her gear up from the cargo hold catwalk and onto the deck. From there she threw the heavy bags across to the dock, where Gregory made sure they landed without falling off into the water on the other side. 

Hemi joined her on the deck. "Take care of yourself, Irene."

"You too, Hemi. And this fuckin' boat. Maybe it will be yours someday, and you'll need an engineer who isn't fuckin' shit at their work." She looked over at Gregory on the dock. "Watch out for those fuckin' guys too. I don't want this to become one of those fuckin' premonition stories I have to tell in a fuckin bar someday, about how I got off this doomed boat just in the fuckin' nick of time. But I can't say I have a good feeling about y'all's future prospects, as it fuckin' were." 

Hemi looked grim. She left him with an awkward hug around his middle and made the jump across to the dock where she hefted her bags and patted Gregory on the back before walking up the dock towards the platform. Hemi and Gregory watched her until she got to the far side of the platform, where it did not take long for her to hail a passing boat that would carry her into the center-city labor yards for shipping.

After Chips had disappeared off the far side of the platform, Gregory was ready to get to work. "Should we set up the gangway, Hemi?"

"Yes. But rather than messing with our own winch, let's ask if we can use the crane." Hemi pointed to the rusty metal structure leaning above their heads. 

Having retrieved a clipboard full of papers that he had left on the catwalk, Hemi climbed down the side of the _Prospect_ and jumped over to the dock to join Gregory. They made their way along the dock and onto the platform. Nobody had yet come out to greet them. Hemi knocked heavily on the door of the little square building.

A few minutes later it was opened by a squat, fat man wearing pince-nez. "Who are you?" he asked Hemi.

"Hemi Howell, deck boss on the _Prospect_." Hemi nodded towards the boat. "We have a delivery." Hemi handed the fat man the clipboard.

"Ah. I'm the dock boss here," said the man as he scanned the top page, lifted it, and ran a bulbous finger down the center of the second page. Unlike most of the residents in Stilt City, the dock boss looked like he had spent most of his working life inside. "Ah, Miss Mai. We expected you two fucking days ago." He looked disappointed. "Authority trouble?"

"An Authority boat took its toll on our progress," Hemi confirmed.

The man let out a small sound of indignation. "Well, you can start unloading if you want to. I'll bring my crew in to help. It'll take them an hour or two to assemble though."

"Can we use your crane?"

"Sure, if you think you know how to drive it. I'm not fucking responsible if you damage your boat in any way, though, got it?"

Hemi nodded.

"There's also some carts over there at the end of the platform. You can use them to offload cargo and move it onto the platform."

"OK...thank you," said Hemi as he took Gregory's arm and turned him back towards the dock.

"And, uh, be careful," continued the dock boss. "If you damage the platform, or say, blow it up, _you_ are fucking responsible, understood?"

Hemi waved an arm in acknowledgment but did not bother turning to look back at the man.

Out of earshot, Gregory asked quietly, "Are we going to start unloading the _Prospect_ by ourselves?"  He imagined the total weight of the hundreds of heavy crates in the hold.

"No. That is their responsibility. They want the cargo, they need to move it. You and I are going to set up the gangway."

Hemi got the engine for the crane started, and when it was pouring black diesel smoke at a nice consistent rate out over the channel, he lowered the boom and dropped the hook into the cargo hold of the _Prospect_. Gregory, down on the deck in the cargo hold, rigged the gangway to it, and Hemi lifted it up and settled it down on deck. Hemi waited for Gregory to appear on deck, and then moved the gangway out over the gap between the boat and the dock, while Gregory guided it into place, and then lashed it down.

With the gangway set, Hemi shut down the crane and made his way back aboard the _Prospect_. He found Percy and advised her they should lay low inside the boat until the dock boss's crew got there. So Percy, Hemi, Bastian, Gregory, and Sir Piero rounded up in the galley around a new pot of coffee. Cassandra had gone off to her rack to catch up on sleep. Hemi sat in the corner of the galley reading a novel the size of a footstone with an illustration on the cover of some tortured pious soul, while the rest got a game of dominoes going.

They proceeded to drink two and a half pots of coffee as a couple of hours passed, but eventually there was the sound of feet on the _Prospect_'s deck above and the grind of the crane's diesel starting up. When Percy got down to the cargo hold, the dock boss's crew of people --- men and women, but all of a hefty dockworker build and wearing tough, undyed canvas clothing --- were already rigging crates onto the hook of the crane and preparing to unload.

The dock and platform that had been so quiet and empty was now full of noise and people. The crates were hoisted out of the cargo hold one-by-one, carefully stacked four to a cart. Then a team of dockworkers hauled the creaking carts up to the platform where the team would unload and stack the crates by hand.

The dock crew worked steadily at it for a few hours, with Percy and Hemi observing from the bridge of the sail where they could keep an eye on things without getting in the way. Generally, there was not much to say. Percy was getting sleepy in the warm and still afternoon air.

Then Percy asked, "So Chips is fucking gone?"

"Yes, gone," said Hemi.

"What are we going to do about that? We need a fucking engineer."

"I think we will feel the loss of Chips poignantly," Hemi said with only the tiniest trace of blame in his voice. "We will have to hire someone qualified eventually. But for the moment, I suppose I will have to take on much of the engineering work."

"That's why you're my fuckin' deck boss, Hemi --- is there nothing you can't do?"

"You know it is not about what I cannot do, it is about having the time to do it. We did well with Cassandra, but we need to hire _skilled_ people. After all, I do not think I need to remind you that we did not just lose Chips, we lost Owen too..."

[//]: # (### Shakes arrives)

Into the middle of their conversation crept the roll of heavy diesels from a large ship moving up the channel. When a horn sounded, they turned to find there was no ship coming from the direction of the engine sound. Hemi lifted his binoculars and scanned the channel until he saw the familiar low outline of the _Gnat_'s sail with a spiky-haired head sticking out of it, and a stream of diesel exhaust flowing out behind.

"Sylvia," said Hemi, "it is the _Gnat_."

"Fuckin' Shakes!" Percy shouted to him and waved her arm in the air.

Shakes waved one arm back at them.

Hemi and Percy made their way down to the dock as Shakes was bringing the _Gnat_ in carefully along the opposite side from the _Prospect_. He put the engine in neutral and hopped out of the sail to catch a dock line tossed to him from Hemi which he secured to the deck cleats.

"How y'all be fuckin' doing?" he asked, while still standing on the deck of the _Gnat_.

"Job completed, and unloading, as you can see," said Percy. "How'd you find us, Shakes?"

"Captain Shakes, if you please. As for finding you: it was fuckin' Herschel, of course! Hang on..." He disappeared into the sail and came back up with a little gray puff of feathers in his hand. Once he got his arms up above the sail, he tossed Herschel into the air. Herschel flapped and then flew circles around the _Gnat_ excitedly while Shakes leapt over to the dock to join Hemi and Percy.

"So the bird actually fucking worked?" Percy asked, unable to totally get the skepticism out of her voice as her eyes continued to follow the bird above.

"Herschel was a total fucking champ! Found me cruising out in the middle of fucking endless expanse of green water. He gave me your message with the dock number...but Herschel was the easy part. The hard part was finding the dock on the way into Stilt City here. Had to stop and ask people probably a dozen fuckin' times --- and folks around here speak a strange fuckin' mix of languages I don't fuckin' understand, mostly."

"It is good to see you, Captain Shakes," said Hemi, "and Herschel. What happened after you left us?"

"Well, there's not much to fuckin' tell of it, really. I drove the _Gnat_ hard in a sorta random northerly direction --- away from the _Prospect_'s location. Did some weaving back and forth and shit, just in case they fired a torp or something, but kept the fuckin' throttle up the whole time. With the volume of the _Gnat_'s engines, I couldn't really be listening to sonar or anything, so I just kept pinging them every ten minutes or so to see how far behind me they were."

"Ah," Hemi interrupted, "so the _Gnat_ does have an active sonar system?"

"Say again? I seem to fuckin' be harder of hearing these days."

Hemi repeated his question.

"Of course! I don't cheap out on anything on my fuckin' boat. So anyways, I kept that _Grackle_ a few miles off and ran them northwards for three or four hours. But by that time the sea was starting to chop up from the storm. The _Gnat_ was taking frothy green water right up against the sail. I figured we were probably far enough from the _Prospect_, so I went silent and dove the _Gnat_ and disappeared under the waves for the duration of the storm. Lost track of the pursuing sub at that point. How'd you all do in that fucking storm?"

"Hemi brought the _Prospect_ up to the surface in the ditch of a ten-meter wave, rolled her right the fuck over. She was completely on her side for a bit, but eventually came upright again," said Percy.

Shakes whistled. "Shit, I never saw weather that fuckin' big on this trip. You must have been much more toward the center of the storm."

Percy went on to fill Shakes in on running into the _Grackle_ on the surface during the storm, and the loss of Owen. Hemi also added that Chips had quit the boat.

"Motherfucker," said Shakes, "you've all had it rough. I feel like I had the easy part of the job. Yet here I fuckin' am to collect my due!"

"It looks like the dockworkers have finished unloading." Hemi noticed that small groups of them had begun to clump up in various places around the platform, idly smoking. "Let's go find that dock boss and settle up."

"You two go on," said Percy. "I'm going to check my cargo hold and make sure they didn't fuck any shit up when they were swinging that iron hook around down there."

[//]: # (### Hemi settles up with the dock boss)

Hemi and Shakes found the dock boss stomping around the dock on a crude prosthetic foot, counting the crates that had come off the _Prospect_ and checking them against a list on a greasy clipboard.

"Hmm. Mr. Howell, the manifest says 215 crates, but I only count 212." The dock boss gestured towards the stacks of crates.

"I do not know what to tell you. Logistics is not an exact science," said Hemi.

"No, it clearly is not. I will adjust the payment based on your delivery." He scribbled some figures with his pencil on the clipboard for a minute and showed it to Hemi. "Does that look right?"

Hemi nodded when he saw that the amount agreed with the calculations he had previously done himself in his head. The dock boss emptied a heavy leather sack of coins onto a crate in front of them and counted out and arranged stacks. When he finished counting --- with Hemi double-checking every stack --- Hemi swept all the coins off the crate with one swipe of his big hand into a canvas bag he pulled from the inside pocket of his tweed jacket. Hemi thanked the dock boss gruffly. As he and Shakes walked back to the _Prospect_, Hemi counted out Shakes's second deck-hand share. They agreed to leave the payment for the modifications to the _Gnat_ for a later time when Shakes could figure the cost more precisely.

They had just stepped onto the dock when Shakes shaded his eyes and looked far up the channel. "What the fuck is going on up there?"

[//]: # (### The Grackle approaches; the Prospect and the Gnat leave)

A black shadow had formed, pushing itself between the brown line of the wooden structures on the water and the gray sky. The shadow rapidly grew and spouted a fin, like some ancient serpent from the deep come to menace the shores corrupted with human endeavors. A thin stream of exhaust rose from it and climbed up into the still air.

"It is them," said Hemi.

"Are you fucking kidding me?" Shakes exclaimed.

"We have to get the boats off, Shakes."

"Fuckin' right we do."

The two of them started running up the dock. The length of the rickety dock shook with the landing of each of Hemi's heavy steps. Shakes jumped from the dock to the deck of the _Gnat_ and had the bow line undone and tossed back to the dock in a few seconds.

Hemi was a few strides behind Shakes and was about to turn up the gangway when Shakes called to him. He turned to look, and Shakes was leaning over from the _Gnat_ with both hands cupping a bundle of feathers. "Take Herschel!"

Hemi nodded as he accepted the bird into his big hands. He held Herschel in one hand as he ran up the gangway shouting to Percy on the bridge. Percy turned to look up the channel and from her height could easily see the approaching black sub. She could even see the strange, fiercely angled shape of the ram mounted on the bow sharply slicing the water.

Hemi leaned over the open cargo hatch as he came up to it on the deck and saw Gregory down in the cargo hold securing pieces of equipment that the dockworkers had moved while unloading the cargo.

"Gregory!" Hemi called down to him through the hatch. "We have to leave immediately. Come up here and throw the lines, then get the cargo hatch closed." Hemi turned towards the sail but Gregory hailed him.

"Hemi! What about the fucking gangway?"

Hemi looked at the rusted and dented ramp leading from the deck of the _Prospect_ to the dock, then back to Gregory. "Just undo its securing lines. We are going to leave it here." 

Hemi turned back towards the sail, hearing a distant "fuck" rise up from the depths of the cargo hold. He was up on the bridge of the sail a few seconds later asking Percy to make sure Gregory got the deck cleared for leaving dock. A few seconds after that he was on the PA in the control room, calling Sir Piero and Bastian to meet him immediately. They both arrived from the galley moments later.

"Our pursuing sub problem has arrived once again Bastian. Get the diesels started, we are leaving. Sir Piero: if you can pilot us back to the main channel in a hurry, there will be a significant bonus for you."

"Alright, Mister Hemi." Sir Piero climbed the ladder up to the bridge from where his piloting would be carried out.

Bastian did not ask any questions. He turned to the motor panel and flipped the starters. A moment after that came the hiss of the high-pressure air turning the diesels over. The engines came to life, filling the _Prospect_ with the reassuring and familiar rumble of its core power.

Sir Piero joined Percy on the bridge. Percy and Gregory established via some consultation yelled back and forth from the top of the sail to the deck that they would leave the gangway and the hawsers. It only took Gregory a few minutes to remove the securing lines from the gangway and undo the hawsers from the _Prospect_'s deck cleats. As soon as they were loose, Percy shouted down to Bastian and Hemi in the control room to reverse thrust and start backing them away from the dock into the turnaround bay. As the _Prospect_ slipped away from the dock, the hawsers draped and then fell in long splashing lines into the water. The gangway scraped along the deck with a loud steel-on-steel sound, and then it followed the hawsers down the side of the _Prospect_'s hull and into the water.

The round dock boss and the dockworkers were standing on the platform watching this procedure, a little stupefied. When the gangway hit the water the dock boss called out to Percy and Sir Piero on the sail. "What are you doing? You can't leave that fucking junk here!"

Percy ignored him, annoyed that she had to leave the junk. Those heavy hawsers were not cheap.

[//]: # (### Shakes rams the Gnat into the Grackle)

On the _Gnat_, Shakes returned to the sail from below deck, where he had thrown the levers that switched the power system from diesel to battery. He stood with his head out of the sail and backed his small boat at a high throttle from the dock, being careful to clear the stern of the _Prospect_ before shifting to forward throttle.  

The sub with the ram had moved quickly up the channel towards them. Defying the local convention of moving through the channels with no wake, it was cruising at an open-ocean speed, swamping small boats on both sides and sending rolling waves up over the platforms and through the lintels of the small huts on either side of the channel. The _Grackle_ had clearly spotted the _Prospect_ at dock and was now moving to the other side of the channel, maneuvering to angle in while maintaining its current speed and aligning to ram the _Prospect_ while it was stuck in the turnaround bay.

With his head above the sail of the _Gnat_, Shakes could see what the monstrous black sub was planning. He lowered himself down to sit in the _Gnat_'s control seat, pulled the sail hatch closed above his head, and sealed it. He opened the valves to flood the ballast.

He began counting to himself as he pulled on a pair of well-broken leather gloves with his teeth, keeping each free hand on the controls as he did so. He lit a cigarette, sucked on it for a second, and then left it propped between his fingers as he used the same hand to give the boat some more throttle.

[//]: # (Glove with his teeth --- ala the Sundance Kid)

The _Gnat_ picked up speed as it dove, the low sail leaving a small v of a wake that shrank away to nothing as it disappeared silently under the surface. Through the viewport of the sail, Shakes could see nothing but sludgy brown water ahead. He steered the boat on his mental time count and instinct, and a subconscious sense of the mathematics involved in the intercept course he planned.

Far faster than he had anticipated, a black wall arose before him. 

[//]: # (Faster than he anticipated because Shakes has a pretty poor sense of the mathematics involved, of course.)

With a last-second hope that he was in fact charging the _Grackle_, and not some random dock, he thrust the throttle lever all the way forward to its stop.

He sucked in a deep breath, and from his diaphragm put all he could into his battle cry: "Ramming speed!" He stuck the cigarette back between his lips. Staring intently out the viewport and with his mouth half-closed, he said, "I always wanted to fucking say that."

The electric motor whined with a pitch that pierced right to the center of Shakes' head. With its last burst of speed, the bow of the _Gnat_ smashed into the looming black underwater wall.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
 

From the sail of the _Prospect_, Percy had watched the _Gnat_ back behind her boat's stern, and then plow forward and dive. That was the last she saw of the _Gnat_ because the water was so brown and silted. The _Grackle_ was just starting to come around to an angle where it could maintain the speed it had gained moving up the channel and still drive into the turnaround bay. The ram turned towards the _Prospect_, and just as it had the angle set so the ram would split the rear quarter of the _Prospect_ --- just as Percy was imagining the crazy fully-uniformed sub commander giving the order to put on a turn of the throttle --- the sickening low crunching sound of an underwater collision came up to her ears, and she watched the bow of the ramming sub divert away from the bay, and back into the channel. As the big submarine came around it took on an unnatural list to one side, its sail hanging clean out over the water. Percy knew immediately what Shakes had done to save them. The sub with the ram carved an awkward path, its forward momentum carrying it up the channel until the ram on the bow collided with a cargo platform, which split in two, a splintering crack widening along the sharp line of the ram. The _Grackle_ ground its way to a stop there.

"Fuck!" Percy called down to the control room. "Hemi, Shakes just drove the _Gnat_ into our fuckin' pursuers! See if you can get him on ship-to-ship." 

But she did not have to wait for Hemi's report. The _Gnat_ rose to the surface out in the channel, its bow heavily dented, but clearly still afloat. A moment later from the top of the sail came Shakes' familiar spiky-haired form waving to the _Prospect_.

[//]: # (### Running back to the main channel in pursuit)

"OK, Sir Piero," Percy said, "it's all on you now, my new fuckin' friend. Can you get us back to the main channel?"

"Yes, yes. You think this is the first pursuit I have done through Stilt City? I have a few tricks up my suit sleeves."

Calling commands down to the control room, he completed backing the _Prospect_ into the turnaround bay, and then pushed out into the channel. They got a good view of the sub with the ram as they passed. Black-uniformed crew were running back and forth on the deck with two-meter pry bars, pushing detritus from the platform off the deck. The channel was too narrow for a ship that size to turn around. If they could get unstuck, they would still have to maneuver into the turnaround bay before they could begin to follow the _Prospect_ and the _Gnat_.

Once Sir Piero had the _Prospect_ out in the channel, he put on as much speed as he thought they could without adding to the swamping of the structures along the channel and without risking accidentally driving into one of those structures. Behind them Percy could see the _Grackle_ was already freeing itself from its stuck position and maneuvering backwards towards the turnaround bay.

With the _Prospect_ successfully underway, Hemi climbed up to the bridge to consult with Percy.

"How the fuck did they find us in Stilt City, Hemi?" Percy asked. "The place is a fucking labyrinth!"

"Either they have exceptional intelligence in a foreign Authority's port --- which seems unlikely --- or they followed the dulcet sounds of the _Gnat_'s ridiculously loud engines."

"Fuck. Yeah. They must have picked Shakes up somewhere on his approach to Stilt City, and then just quietly followed him into fucking port and through the city."

"With Shakes constantly stopping to ask directions, it may not have been very difficult to do."

"Well, maybe we can get them to follow him back out too. Sir Piero, can we take your shortcut again --- back to the main channel?"

"That is maybe not such a good idea. Faster overall, but the sub marine has to go much slower through," said Sir Piero.

"I'm willing to go slower if it means losing our fucking pursuers though," said Percy. "Hemi, let's ask Shakes to start the diesel on the _Gnat_, and we'll leave him to go back up the bigger channel he came in from. We'll turn into the shortcut, and with some luck, maybe the _Grackle_ will follow his loud ass instead of us." In one way it felt like a lot to ask of Shakes, who had just risked his boat for them. But one of Percy's principles of leadership was that if someone shows initiative, give them more responsibility.

"Alright," Hemi said. "I will raise Shakes on the ship-to-ship and let him know the plan."

"There's too much of a risk that those fuckwads will overhear it if you use ship-to-ship. You should probably just flag Shakes down and shout across to him."

[//]: # (Shakes is still running on battery here, so he has no problem hearing Hemi.)

"Alright," said Hemi again, and climbed over the fairing of the sail and down to the deck. Percy watched him shout for Shakes' attention, and when Shakes heard him, he pulled the _Gnat_ alongside the _Prospect_ and he and Hemi ironed out the details of the plan by yelling across the gap between the two boats. When he was done, Hemi climbed up to the sail and back down into the control room.

"How much further do we have to go to the shortcut?" Percy asked Sir Piero.

"Just another quarter mile or so. We have to slow the boat down even before we get there --- it is easy to miss a small lane like that, and also, no turnaround." 

"OK. When you're sure you're close, have Bastian slow us down as much as you think you need to." Percy looked behind. There was no pursuing sub there, but she could only see about a quarter mile down the channel before the sighting was lost in the winding ways of the channel and the clusters of warehouses and cargo platforms. A quarter mile was nothing. The _Grackle_ might be right behind them, but she had no way of knowing.

A few minutes later Sir Piero called down to Bastian to slow the _Prospect_ to five knots. Sir Piero scanned the signs and structures along the port side of the channel ahead of them. Then he pointed to a small, rapidly-approaching gap between the huts built along the channel. "There it is, Captain Percy."

She nodded. "None too fucking soon," she said with another glance behind. Still there was no pursuing sub. She put two fingers in her mouth and let out a loud, short whistle that rose in pitch. Shakes looked up at her from the sail of the _Gnat_ following behind the _Prospect_. She waved to him and pointed to the wider channel. He waved back to show he understood, cigarette in hand.

As Sir Piero brought the _Prospect_ into the narrow way of the shortcut, Percy could hear the cough and sputter of the _Gnat_'s diesel starting even above the significant rumble of the _Prospect_'s own engines. As Sir Piero began his careful navigation of the shortcut pass, Percy kept looking back to make sure the _Grackle_ had not come into sight.  Carbonous black soot shot up in a long stream from the _Gnat_ as if the small boat were aflame. Shakes' head disappeared for a few seconds from the sail as he went below to connect the diesel engine to the prop drive. A moment later he reappeared and put the engine in gear. The _Gnat_ cruised quickly and noisily off up the channel.

[//]: # (### The pursuing sub after the Prospect in the shortcut)

The _Prospect_ moved into the small channel between the huts, backtracking the route it had come in by. Sir Piero had them moving faster this time though, kicking up enough wake to slosh up against the bottoms of the huts, but just short of driving water into the huts. That did not prevent residents from coming out and cursing their passing.

As before, they wound their way through the small homes. Sir Piero faced the bow and scanned the path in front of them with binoculars. Occasionally he cupped a hand around his mouth and yelled forward loudly in various local languages to try to get a local fisherman or kids rowing tiny coracles to make way for the _Prospect_ to pass. He kept up a never-ending stream of instructions to Hemi and Bastian below, making tiny corrections in their course to keep them in the center of the narrow passage.

Percy rode her boat facing the stern, on the lookout for the thing she feared --- the black shadow of the sub rising up somewhere back in their wake, among the densely-clustered huts. 

She was just beginning to believe the _Grackle_ may have gone for the bait and followed the _Gnat_ when she heard a muffled thump and crunching wood coming from some distance behind. The sounds bounced over the thatched roofs of the huts. Through her binoculars she saw long boards, clumps of thatch, and huge splinters shooting up into the air. Every few seconds, another hollow thump and crunch, followed by more splintering wood. 

The thumps came faster, flowing together until the detritus of the huts was being blasted into the air in a long continuous stream of pulverized wood and straw. The ram of the _Grackle_ was being used to plow a direct route through, as though the ramshackle homes were nothing but so much snow needing to be cleared from the central artery of some Northern city. A path of monstrous destruction, moving rapidly towards the _Prospect_.

"Sir Piero, that sub that was after us? They are coming this way," said Percy. "Is there any chance we can move faster through here?"

Sir Piero looked behind him and saw the rampaging destruction headed towards them.

"Sorry, Captain Percy, I am not destroying my neighbors' homes for the sake of your boat."

"You aren't going to ground us again, are you? We're finished if we get stopped."

"No, no. No fucking way! Your boat was loaded before. It is unloaded now --- lots of clearance."

"Unless the tide went out..." said Percy.

Sir Piero did not reply. He resumed shouting directions down to the control room.

[//]: # (### The pursuing sub gets stuck)

Percy did not have nearly as much faith as Sir Piero that the _Prospect_ would clear the bars of shallow muck so easily, even with her boat unloaded. She asked Hemi to keep a close eye on the depth-under-keel gauge and let her know immediately if the warning light came on.

It was only moments later that she could see ahead the shade of water with a distinctively different ripple pattern on the surface that indicated a shallow spot running across the lane. Sir Piero pointed it out to her, but did not order the _Prospect_ to slow down at all. Percy tripped down the ladder to the control room and watched the depth-under-keel gauge intently. The needle lowered itself down till it triggered the warning light, and sank to under a meter of water, but they cruised over the shallow spot without even touching the muck this time.

She climbed back up to the bridge with a smile on her face and patted Sir Piero on the back. She was feeling a sense of relief not just from clearing the bar so easily, but also because her intuition about the size and displacement of the sub pursuing them suggested to her that the _Prospect_ might have an opportunity coming.

She lifted her binoculars and leaned out from the sail to get a clear view around the _Prospect_'s exhaust stream. The _Grackle_ was still charging recklessly up the narrow passage, splintering the little huts on both sides of the waterway. She could see the faint shadows of people atop the sail directing its course. With no reduction in speed at all, it drove into the shallow bar. 

The sharp leading edge of the ram plowed deep enough into the sludgy ground that the muck erupted from the bottom in a thick black moraine that rose until it cleared the surface. A small tsunami of brown water, turbid with mud, rose and traveled up the small channel before the stuck boat.

Their pursuers were stopped dead in the passage. Through her binoculars, Percy imagined she could almost see the figures of the people on the bridge of the sail thrust forward against the edge of the fairing as the momentum suddenly came off the boat. She could see an arm raised in anger and hear the vitriol spilling off the sub's sail.

As soon as the residents in the surrounding area realized what happened, they attacked the grounded sub, throwing rotting food, scraps of wood, and rusted bars of metal at the black monster that had been tearing up their neighborhood.  

The _Grackle_ began shooting jets of bilge water out of its sides, and presumably blowing any remaining water out of their ballast tanks as well. Percy could see they were also driving forward at full throttle, hoping to push through the shallow spot on straight power. The screws were kicking up a tremendous wash of frothy water behind the sub, enough that nearby huts leaned back from the pressure against their stilts. 

This angered the residents still more. They began to land on the stuck sub, beating on the deck with long metal poles and trying to pry up hatches. One local tried to climb the hand holds to the sail. That was when Percy saw the thin shadow of an arm extend and then a flash, followed a moment later by the report of a small-caliber pistol reaching her ears. The body of the climber fell back through the air, hit the curved deck of the sub and slid into the brackish water.

After that, the people on the bridge opened up on the locals --- shot after shot rang across the water. Figures fell to the deck amid the mass of residents scrambling to get off the deck and back to their small boats and canoes alongside. 

[//]: # (### Into the main channel; pay off Sir Piero)

The _Prospect_ was now gaining crucial ground on their pursuers, quickly finding their path through the winding way. Soon Percy could see the main channel ahead. Further behind, amid the chaos and the violence, it did appear that the _Grackle_ was making headway against its bottoming. Percy estimated they might push clear with just a few minutes more.

The _Prospect_ turned out into the main channel and Percy took over command. She immediately had Bastian throttle up to the _Prospect_'s full surface speed of fifteen knots. 

"Careful, Captain Percy," said Sir Piero. "I cannot recommend all this speed in the channel full of big heavy ships and small wobbly boats. If any Authority vessels spots the _Prospect_, they will intervene to try to keep order in the channel."

"I fucking know it. But those fuckers behind us are certainly not going to take it easy in the channel --- maybe the Authority will intervene with them instead!"

"That seems true enough. Here I must leave you, then. If the Authority catches me piloting a craft at this speed in the channel, I will no longer be a pilot. Besides, there's fifty meters of water in the channel, you do not need me any more --- as long as you manage not to get crushed by a moving freighter."

"Well, fuck. That was as fine a bit of piloting as I have ever seen," said Percy. She leaned over and called down to Hemi in the control room. "Hemi! Toss up the pay for Sir Piero."

Hemi underhanded a small cloth pouch clinking with coins up from the control room and Percy snatched it from the zenith of its rise.

She handed it to Sir Piero. "You'll find a generous gratuity in there for your work under tense conditions, Sir Piero."

"I am the best pilot in the city, Captain Percy! If you come in this way again, be sure to ask for me."

"We fuckin' will, for sure. Can you get your boat off at this speed? I really don't want to slow down."

"No problem. I was born and bred on the water!"

Sir Piero tucked the bag of coins into his pants, gave Percy a casual salute, and nimbly went over the side of the sail. He pulled his wherry to the edge of the deck and sat down in it. He lifted his paddle and pushed off. He slid the tiny craft down the curve of the _Prospect_'s hull and into the rapidly passing water like someone maneuvering over a big rock in river rapids. After a few paddles he had safely made some distance from the giant steel cylinder flying past, and he paused to give one final wave to Percy on the sail before paddling in the direction of a large oiler that was crawling upstream to see if he could win a second job for the day.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
 

[//]: # (### Navigating out of the channel)

Percy climbed down to the control room while closing and sealing the hatch above her head.

"Did you guys get the cargo hatch sealed?" she asked.

"Yup," replied Gregory as he pointed upwards to the hatch control panel lit up all green indicating all the hatches on the boat were sealed.

Percy punched the dive alarm. "OK, take us down to periscope depth." 

"Sylvia," said Hemi, "may I suggest that we send up Herschel with a rendezvous point for Shakes before we dive?"

"Ah shit, the fuckin' bird. You're right." She pressed the dive alarm button a second time to deactivate it, and then got on the PA that echoed through the whole boat to let anyone listening know that the dive had been postponed. She did this even though the only person on the boat who was not in the control room at that moment was Cassandra --- and she was only a few meters below in the sonar compartment. It was simply good practice to use the PA to announce boat maneuvers regardless of the location of your crew members, as Chips had often pointed out to her.

Hemi climbed down to the navigation station and reviewed the chart laid out under the glass. Leaning over with the magnifier in his hand, he selected a spot of deep water just off the continental shelf, about a day's run out from Stilt City. Holding a tiny scrap of paper down against the glass of the navigation table with splayed fingers, he copied the coordinates with a sharp pencil. He also selected a backup location for the rendezvous just in case something went wrong and noted that on the reverse side of the paper. He scooped Herschel up from the deck where the bird had been walking around aimlessly and fixed the tiny paper into Herschel's leg cylinder. 

Percy was anxious to get the boat underwater, so as soon as she saw Hemi starting up the ladder to the control room with Herschel in one hand and nodding to her, she punched the dive alarm again. "Start the dive. Hemi, get the bird off."

Bastian flipped off the diesel engines and their rumble died away beneath their feet to leave only the much quieter hum of the electric motors. Gregory opened the main ballast valves. Hemi opened the hatch above the control room; a light on the hatch control panel lit up a brilliant red, and an alarm sounded because the main ballast valves were open at the same time as one of the boat hatches.

Hemi quickly climbed to the sail and tossed a fluttering Herschel up into the wind. Air was shooting out from the top of the deck in front of him, carrying long streams of mist from the ballast tanks as high as the _Prospect_'s sail, which blew back in his face. He took one last look at Herschel, who had rapidly gained altitude and was now heading directly back upriver, hopefully towards the _Gnat_.

Hemi dropped below and resealed the hatch, silencing the alarm from the hatch control panel.

When the depth gauge showed the sail was under, Percy raised up the scope. As it came level with her eyes, she leaned into the viewfinder and started slowly scanning a full circle around the _Prospect_. She paid particular attention to the rear quarters, trying to see if she could catch a glimpse of the _Grackle_ behind. The sub would be harder to spot from the lower vantage of periscope depth, particularly with all the traffic in the channel, but Percy felt that running submerged would be safer than cruising on the surface.

The pursuing sub was not within visual range. It was possible that it had gotten stuck again while navigating one of the other shallow spots in Sir Piero's shortcut. Percy wondered if the _Prospect_ might be free and clear to head out to sea. But she was still going to use every tactic she could put together to get away discreetly.

She focused the periscope forward and spoke without pulling back from the viewfinder. "Hemi, there's a big fuckin' outward bound cargo hauler about a quarter mile up the channel. I think I want to put the _Prospect_ under it and hide in its shadow until we're well the fuck out."

"It is a dangerous maneuver in these shallow waters, Sylvia," said Hemi.

"That's why I need you on sonar. And their speed is pretty slow --- that will make it a bit safer."

"Alright," said Hemi. "I will get on sonar with Cassandra, it will be good training for her to listen to this." Hemi climbed down to the sonar station and had Cassandra move into the second sonar seat so he could more easily manage the sonar controls and filters himself. They both put on the headsets and concentrated on the sounds coming in as Hemi rotated the sonar directional control around 360 degrees for a full picture of the surrounding traffic.

With Hemi settled on sonar, Percy brought the _Prospect_ down to twenty meters below the surface. In some ways this made Hemi's job simpler, because all the traffic was now above them --- there should be no other submerged submarines in the channel. But with only fifty meters of depth to play with, the sounds of the traffic above reflected off the bottom of the channel, back up, and then off in every direction, making the space they were moving through feel very compressed to Hemi.

They had maintained a fast fifteen knots since submerging. One of the first things Hemi asked Percy to do was to slow the boat down --- both because it would make the sonar clearer, and because even at six knots he estimated they would be doing twice the speed of the cargo ship above his head.

Hemi began a steady and careful dialogue with Percy, much of which she relayed to Bastian and Gregory, to bring the _Prospect_ up under the cargo ship, and then throttle back to match the slow-moving, building-sized ship that was cruising above.

Percy stood directly next to Gregory and worked the tank trim panel herself, feeling the weight of her ship through its movements and finding an absolutely neutral buoyancy. When she was satisfied that her boat was trimmed so it would be perfectly level without any out-of-balance forces causing them to gain or lose depth, she took one step back from the panel. She tracked Gregory's moves on the dive plane carefully.

"Bastian, do what you have to with the rudder; we have space to play with to our sides," she said. "But Gregory: only make the most delicate moves on the dive planes --- one degree up or down, maximum. We want to have lots of time to correct before we drive the bow into the muck or the sail into that steel wall above us."

"Right, Captain," said Gregory, gripping the dive plane wheel. His eyes darted back and forth from the boat level indicators to the depth indicator to the depth-under-keel gauge.

After twenty minutes without incident, they were feeling more confident with the maneuver and maintaining their position. Percy wondered if they might be able to cruise right out into deep water like this, and then spend the rest of the day running deep until they were well out and away from Stilt City.

Then a loud active sonar ping pierced through the _Prospect_'s hull. 

"Hemi!" Percy called down to sonar. "Where the fuck did that come from? Was it them?"

There was a brief silence while Hemi continued listening. Then he called back up to the control room, "The source was roughly a mile back up the river behind us. It must have been the _Grackle_. I do not imagine anyone else has a reason to be sending out pings. They must have guessed we submerged, and decided that if they lit up the river with a ping, the only boat underwater would be us."

"Do you think that will work?" Percy asked Hemi.

"There is enough distance and so much traffic on the water that the ping will be reflecting back massive amounts of information to them. There is a good chance we will be lost in all the noise."

"OK, we're sticking with the current fucking plan then."

Every few minutes another ping rang out. Hemi reported that the pursuing sub was rapidly gaining on them with each ping. But the _Prospect_, still under the giant umbrella of the cargo ship above, was moving out of the channel and into more open water. Hemi could tell by the dispersing traffic that the main channel was much wider now --- miles wide. He also estimated that they would soon be passing the structures built at the furthest extent of Stilt City.

[//]: # (### They drop to the bottom and try to hide along the continental shelf.)

Percy watched the depth-under-keel dial closely for fifteen minutes or so as three more pings washed through them. The depth of the water was a fairly consistent fifty meters, varying slightly towards the deeper direction in some places. The cargo ship maintained a straight course out from the channel, and the _Prospect_ held its spot under it. Moving into more open waters meant they were more exposed. Any moment now the commander of the _Grackle_ might figure out that the sonar shadow of the cargo ship above them was much too large. Percy needed to make a move.

She climbed down to the navigation station. "Hemi, how good are our charts for this area?" she asked as she leaned over with the magnifying glass. "Can we run close to the bottom without risking plowing into some uncharted feature?"

Hemi and Cassandra looked over at her without removing their headsets.

"The charts are good. We are also still on the continental shelf, there are not many features to begin with," said Hemi.

Percy leaned over the chart. If it was accurate, then Hemi was right. It showed a flat unvarying plane, fifty to sixty meters deep, running out about two hundred miles from the port of Stilt City. There were much bigger shelf areas in the world, but two hundred miles was longer than most.

"You are thinking we could hide from the pings if we are close enough to the bottom?" Hemi asked.

Percy nodded. "Yeah. With all the fucking pinging, they are going to find us under the cargo ship any second now. Putting ourselves just off the bottom is the only other way I can think of that will let us hide from them."

"I have heard that some of the sonar rigs Authorities are using now are good enough to pick out a boat on the bottom," said Hemi somewhat doubtfully.

"Then let's assume their sonar is of fairly fuckin' average quality. After all, I'm pretty sure they lost us on the tablemount like that."

"They may have also just assumed we sunk back then."

"Well, unless you have a better fuckin' idea..."

"I do not," said Hemi, as another ping hit them. He turned back to his work on the sonar unit.

Percy climbed to the control room. She worked with Gregory on the dive planes and the trim tanks to bring the boat to a scant two meters off the bottom. She had them slow to two knots to make it less catastrophic if they hit anything --- there was no such thing as a perfect chart. Hemi reported that the cargo ship above was creeping away ahead of the _Prospect_.

After a few minutes Percy noticed that the regular pings had stopped. "Hemi, what the fuck is going on? No more pings?"

"I am hearing high-speed ships heading toward the location of the last ping source," he called up. "It is possible that all the pinging they were doing has attracted some unfriendly attention."

"Ah," said Percy, "the Stilt City Authority ships are on them?"

"Hang on..."

Percy could not see Hemi from where she was standing in the control room, but in her mind she had a perfect vision of him holding one thick finger up in the air towards her. 

A minute passed. Then the crew in the control room heard low rumblings that came into the _Prospect_'s hull through the water in a softly percussive succession. Gregory looked at her.

"Fuckin' depth charges," she said. And when his eyes took on a bit of prey-like fear, she added, "A little fuckin' ways off, though."

"The Authority surface ships are dropping charges, Sylvia," Hemi confirmed from the sonar compartment.

"Ha," said Percy, "we should have thought of this before: it's a known truism that the best way to get out from under the attention of one fuckin' Authority is to sic another Authority on 'em. Bastian, let's take this opportunity to change course. Maybe we will finally be able to lose these fuckers. Come around to something north-ish."

"Right, Cap," said Bastian, rolling the rudder control wheel in his hands to port as the compass on the wall of gauges started to swing.

[//]: # (### They think they are finally sneaking away from the pursuers)

Percy moved down to the sonar station, and for the next hour or so, Hemi reported charges being dropped in waves while Percy stood behind him, watching the dials of the sonar rig rise and fall with the sounds Hemi and Cassandra were hearing. "It seems like they are dropping charges in a random pattern around the area where the last ping came from an hour ago," Hemi said, mapping an image in his head of the rough location of the dozens of explosions he had heard.

"It could be the _Grackle_ is now hiding on the bottom themselves," Percy replied. "The Stilt City Authority ships probably lost them in that brown muck water from the river outflow, and are hoping a random charge will force them to the surface." 

"Given the intensity of the attack, I would suggest that it is unlikely the _Grackle_ could survive," said Hemi. "And I would add I have recently heard sounds that would be not inconsistent with the failure of a pressure hull."

"The Stilt City Authority boats destroying the _Grackle_ would surely be a blessing from hell. If we had a way to _confirm_ their sinking, we could sleep easy for the first time in a long time. That would be the greatest fuckin' blessing of 'em all."

As much as Percy wanted to cruise out of the area at high speed, she still did not want to risk giving away the _Prospect_'s position. They crawled at a painfully slow, but discreet, three knots on the more or less random northerly course Bastian had chosen for the rest of the daylight hours. By dark they had left the noise of the depth charges far behind, along with any kind of contact or signal that they might still be pursued.
