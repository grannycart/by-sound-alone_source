## 7. Garbage Gyre


[//]: # (### Rendezvous with Shakes)

With darkness spreading above, Hemi was able to take a sighting from a star, and he calculated they had made about twenty nautical miles from the point where they had last heard the faintest echo of the depth charges. Percy felt that was enough of a cushion that they could start the diesels, and the engines were soon roaring below decks. Percy had the boat throttled up to fifteen knots, and Hemi calculated a precise easterly course that would bring them to the rendezvous point with Shakes. Percy kept a lookout in the ring throughout the night and gambled on not using the radar, feeling that it was too likely to give them away.

They ran through the night on too much coffee and not enough sleep. But they saw no other vessels, and there was no sign of the _Grackle_.

Even as the sun rose ahead, Percy kept the boat on the surface, hoping to make the rendezvous with Shakes more or less on time. The sun was well above the horizon and there was clear visibility for something like ten miles from the lookout ring before Percy finally called for the submarine to submerge. There were only a few more miles more to the rendezvous point with Shakes, and Percy had confidence that Hemi would navigate them with his usual high precision to the correct spot.

A few hours later, Hemi announced they had arrived at the rendezvous point. They leveled the boat at twenty meters of depth and shut down the motors to wait. Everyone except Cassandra passed the midday and afternoon hours in lazy recuperation, catching up on sleep. Cassandra was stuck listening to sonar, trying to detect Shakes's approach. In the late afternoon she caught the far-off sound of a loud diesel engine, and by the time ten minutes had passed she was sure it was the _Gnat_, approaching the rendezvous at a high speed on the surface.

At a few miles off, the sound of the diesel disappeared. Cassandra assumed Shakes was diving before approaching the rendezvous point. Percy called Hemi up to the control room. An hour later Shakes's voice came in over the ship-to-ship. Hemi arranged with Shakes to mate the _Gnat_ to the underside of the _Prospect_. It took another hour to execute the delicate maneuver.

Hemi sent Bastian down to the lowest deck of the _Prospect_ to open the hatch to the _Gnat_. Even as he climbed up through the hatch, helped by Bastian's strong grip, Shakes was already thinking about food.

"Bastian! Good to fuckin' see you again. It's about dinner time on this fuckin' vessel, ain't it?"

"Sure it fucking is, Captain Shakes," said Bastian, through a cigarette in his mouth. "I think I smelled Gregory working on some fucking sticky glop or other in the galley when I was comin' down here. You hungry?"

"Submarining is hungry fucking work, Bastian. Let's go see what that feller is burning."

They made their way up the decks with the wrenches hanging from Shakes's belt clanking loudly each time they ascended one of the ladders or steep stairways. In the galley, Hemi and Percy were sitting at the table and Gregory had a big curved steel pan from which smoke was rising. They all sat, and Gregory delivered a heavy meal of boiled oats and cabbage with small bits of slightly-charred canned ham sprinkled throughout. The oats had enough texture still left to them that the little grains popped between their teeth. Hemi brought a bowl in to Cassandra, who was still on sonar duty.

After Shakes ate his third bowl, Gregory poured everyone a cup of the requisite coffee. Percy leaned back into the corner of the galley bench, stretching her arms.

"I see you made it out of that fuckin' Stilt City," said Shakes. "When that sub turned off the channel to follow the _Prospect_ into that narrow waterway, I thought maybe our partnership was fuckin' done for."

"Yet you still managed to make the fuckin' rendezvous point," said Percy.

"Well, the last job working for you was so fuckin' profitable, I wasn't going to let that go just because I thought y'all were fucking dead."

Percy chuckled.

"So what's the fuckin' plan now? Is there a next job?" asked Shakes.

"For the moment, the plan is to put as much distance between ourselves and the last place we saw that fucking _Grackle_ as possible. If there's even a chance they are still swimming, we'll have to lose those fuckers for good before resuming business as usual. I can cut you loose if you like, Shakes --- it's mostly our fuckin' headache, not yours."

Shakes stirred a number of spoonfuls of sugar into his coffee. "And what if I'm willing to make it my headache too?"

"Regardless of what fouled spring from which our continuous fuckin' bad luck flows, I'd be happy to have you along if you're fuckin' willing. Having the _Gnat_ around could prove useful again."

"So you'll keep me on fuckin' retainer?"

"Sure, if you like."

"Alright," said Shakes. "With the condition that you make Gregory continue to feed me, I'll stick with y'all for now."

"You know I do take care of a few other things on this boat besides the fuckin' food," Gregory put in.

Percy ignored Gregory. "Once we've covered some significant expanse of ocean without crossing paths with the _Grackle_ again, we'll put into a port somewhere and start looking for work. And hopefully we'll be able to include the _Gnat_ in whatever new endeavor we take up."

[//]: # (### Into the garbage gyre)

When the clock indicated that it was fully dark above the waves, Percy had the _Prospect_ driven up to the surface. Hemi and Shakes got the _Gnat_ disconnected and surfaced. Soon both boats were running parallel to each other across a black sea of modest swells. The sky was loaded with heavy clouds which brought with them a steady breeze that drove the waves against the boats. The clouds made the night dark. So much so that while it was easy to hear the _Gnat_'s diesel engine from the bridge of the _Prospect_, it could not be seen through the blackness, except for the occasional spark of flame that escaped from its exhaust stack.

They kept a steady eastern course, moving deep into the central ocean. With both boats running their diesel engines, they could sustain high speeds. Maintaining a steady fifteen-knot average, they covered the vast distances of the open ocean relatively quickly.

Percy rode up on the bridge. Given the unmitigated darkness, she decided to forego putting a lookout in the ring. She had never felt like she had all the crew she needed to run the boat effectively, but having lost Owen and Chips, she was feeling more pinched than ever by too few hands.

With no visibility on deck, and the sonar nearly useless over the volume of sound the diesel engines dumped into the water, the only real vision Percy had was on radar. So every twenty minutes, she had Cassandra turn on the radar for a few sweeps to make sure the ocean remained clear in front of them --- and that nobody was tailing behind.

For the first few hours of the night, they settled into the monotonous drudgery of cruising. Gregory was in his rack, Cassandra listened to heavy noise in the sonar headset, Percy stared into the darkness from the bridge, and Hemi and Bastian stared at the wall of unmoving dials in the control room.

Toward midnight, Hemi climbed tiredly down to the sonar station and tapped Cassandra on the shoulder. She did not even look up, having been expecting Hemi's signal that it was time to do another radar check. She leaned over and flipped the switch. The green light of the radar flashed across the scope, then swept slowly around, showing nothing behind or to the sides, except for the lone blip of the _Gnat_ to starboard.

But as the radar passed to the front of the _Prospect_ it laid down a sprinkling of green glowing dots, like fireflies above an evening field, that slowly faded away until the sweep came around a second time and lit them all up again. A few of the dots were only a mile or two ahead of the _Prospect_. Further away they increased in density to a number that could not be quickly counted.

"Hemi, what's that? It looks like a fleet!" said Cassandra, her eyes going wide and reflecting the green glow of the radar display.

"Hmm. That is not alright. Bastian!" Hemi called to the control room. "Throttle back to five knots...and shut down the diesels!"

The sound of the diesels faded. Percy arrived in the sonar compartment soon after, having been directed there from above by Bastian. "What the fuck is going on, Hemi?"

He pointed to the scope as he adjusted the second sonar headset over his ears. "We are going to give that strange assemblage of radar contacts a listen."

Percy flipped off the radar. "Let's not give away our position more than we already fuckin' have. What do you think, should we dive?"

"I don't hear anything, Captain Percy," Cassandra interrupted. "At least, not above Shakes's engine."

"For fuck's sake. Ping him," Percy ordered. "We need Shakes to shut down, and he might respond to a ping."

Hemi reached over Cassandra and pressed the ping button on the active sonar. The unit lit up.

"The active unit is showing dozens of contacts _underwater_ as well as on the surface." Cassandra kept one hand against the sonar earpiece. "Shakes did shut down --- but I still don't hear anything. It's completely silent now."

"It is extremely unlikely that there is a fleet of dozens of ships and subs just floating without engines running," said Hemi. "Something else is going on here..."

From the sonar compartment they could hear Shakes's voice crackling questions over the ship-to-ship in the control room and Bastian responding to him.

"I suggest we make use of our friend Shakes as a resource," Hemi said.

"Send the reckless risk-taker to check out the frightening unknown objects? That's my kind of fuckin' plan, Hemi." Percy climbed up to the control room and took over the conversation with Shakes. She explained the situation to him and together they came up with a plan where Shakes would move forward on battery and check out the radar contacts while the _Prospect_ submerged to periscope depth and followed behind, staying within ship-to-ship range of the _Gnat_.

Fifteen minutes later, the _Gnat_ was coming up on the first of the radar contacts. Percy watched the blackness where the _Gnat_ was located ahead of them through the periscope. Soon a beam of light shot out from the water, and in the reflection of it she could see Shakes's spiky head at the top of the sail of the _Gnat_. Shakes ran the light beam forward and back along a black wall that rode up and down on the ocean swell ahead of him.

At this range Cassandra was now able to hear the object on the sonar --- water slapping against a steel void with the random regularity of ocean chop. She was convinced it was a ship. 

Only a few minutes later, Shakes confirmed her guess over radio. *"Yeah, _Prospect_, the object is a big empty cargo vessel. Rusting away and half sunk, it looks like. You think all those contacts are abandoned ships?"*

Percy looked away from the periscope viewfinder at Hemi, who was holding the ship-to-ship radio mic. "What do you think, Hemi?"

"It is possible. I have heard rumors of such things: abandoned ships, among other refuse, float into some kind of slow gyre in the middle of the ocean where they sometimes circle for decades before they weaken enough for the ocean to draw them down."

"A fucking graveyard," said Bastian.

[//]: # (Is the garbage gyre the Zone from Stalker? Abso-fucking-lutely! But is not everything the Zone in one way or another?)

"A walk among those lost souls might be a fucking opportunity for a pair of boats that don't want to be found," said Percy. "Hemi, see if you can work out a way with Shakes that we might traverse this graveyard without physically encountering any of the ghosts that live there."

Hemi and Shakes chatted for a few minutes over the ship-to-ship. They decided that if they kept the speed low, they should be able to navigate through the sea of derelicts safely. 

The _Prospect_ surfaced and pushed forward at three knots. The _Gnat_ took up a position 100 meters or so behind. Shakes kept the _Gnat_'s diesel off as he followed in the _Prospect_'s wake so he could keep in constant contact with the _Prospect_ over the ship-to-ship.

[//]: # (Does the ship-to-ship work with the diesels running? Lets say yes, but a much more limited distance.)

At first, Cassandra was able to steer them around the big pieces of flotsam using the sonar. Since the ocean was quiet, she could hear the _Prospect_'s diesel engines bouncing off the bigger floating pieces. But soon they entered an area so densely packed with wrecked hulks that they needed to use the active sonar to chart their way precisely through it. They started pinging at regular intervals a few minutes apart, and Cassandra would report obstructions ahead --- both above and below the surface. Hemi noted her reports on a clipboard and worked out a safe route forward. 

[//]: # (The distinction between flotsam and jetsam applies here: flotsam is debris not deliberately throw overboard, like from a sinking ship, while jetsam is stuff thrown overboard on purpose.)

Percy ran a power wire up to the bridge and connected a hand-held spotlight. She swept a beam back and forth, scraping away at the blackness in front of her boat. Most of the contacts Cassandra was seeing with the sonar were partially or almost entirely submerged, held aloft over the thousand-meter-deep ocean by clinging to the last desperate bubble of buoyancy yet retained from when the ships were living. Under Percy's light, the vessels were typically low, black, curved, and oily forms, cowering just at the level of the surface, awash with waves that passed over and obscured them. Alternatively, they would take the figure of a low wall in the water, still showing the distinctive outline of the pointed form of a ship hull.

As they made their way farther, the debris in the water grew more abundant. The breeze they had been driving into earlier died away and the ocean flattened out, as if held down by the thick greasy blanket of refuse laying on it. Among the larger debris pieces of the derelict vessels there were rafts of smaller junk clumping together: rotting wood from ship decking and furniture, rusting barrels, bits of foam covered in bright cloth, frayed lines, bleached-pale buoys and fenders, pieces of masts, and tool handles. Anything that might fall from a ship or get tossed into the ocean and did not immediately sink seemed to have made its way to this huge gyre of garbage. Pieces bumped eerily against the hull of the _Prospect_ with deep resonant thumps that could be heard throughout the boat. In many places an iridescent oily sheen sprinkled with clumps of floating grease reflected back in Percy's light.

Gregory, in the lookout ring, suddenly turned to one side with a jerk. "Captain Percy, am I hallucinating? I think I saw movement up on one of those low-sunken ships off the port side."

Percy immediately switched off the light. She peered into the darkness in the direction Gregory indicated. For a moment it was a futile effort to see where there was no light for her eyes to receive. But then, a bright blue light outlined the shadow of a hunched gaunt figure in the middle-distance, just off to one side of the point she had been staring at in the darkness. It took her a moment to realize that she recognized the light of a cutting torch. 

"Scavengers, Gregory. Any source of scrap metal, no matter how remote, will also have someone who knows how to transform it into fucking treasure. It's possible they live out here. Sometimes whole communities will develop around a resource like this."

Percy turned the spotlight back on but did not shine it in the direction of the cutting torch, guessing that scavengers in a place like this would prefer to be left alone. A moment later the _Prospect_ was slowly motoring past a low barge half loaded with a mound of rusting steel.

[//]: # (### Through the dense part of the garbage patch at night; then in the morning they dive, and Cassandra hears the Grackle)

They spent the entire night pinging their way through the densely polluted surface water with the _Gnat_ following dutifully behind. Percy instinctively felt uncomfortable about the racket the two ships were making, especially since every ping told anyone within a ten, maybe even twenty, mile radius precisely where they were. And, of course, even at a near-idle, the _Gnat_'s diesel --- which Shakes was now running again --- growled loudly, with sympathetic vibrations bouncing from the abandoned ship hulls surrounding them. Percy reassured herself that they were far off any routine shipping lanes, and most vessels would choose a route around this patch that they had chosen to plunge into. The refuse patch increasingly appeared to be quite a massive obstacle.

The boats were still on the surface, and Percy was still standing on the bridge of the _Prospect_, when the morning sun eased itself up over the eastern horizon. Its long red rays ignited the landscape of black hulks around them until it looked like boats were stirring on the dead waters of an underworld lake of blood.

As the sun crept upwards and its light filled out the entire spectrum, the lake of blood turned into a turbid and viscous black sea --- all the bunker fuels, engine lubricants, solvents and greases; all the specially developed chemical mixes that drove or eased the movements of the giant steel machines through the water --- all eventually escaped from the rotting containers that held them and contaminated the pure sea water of the middle ocean. The contaminants floated on the surface, coating and binding together bits of more solid refuse. The stuck-together grime coalesced and joined forces with larger pieces that floated in defiance of the power of the perpetually sucking bottomless hole underneath.

By the full light of day, Percy felt far too exposed. She waved down Shakes until he stopped the _Gnat_'s engine and Hemi could contact him via radio to tell him to bring the _Gnat_ underneath and mate with the _Prospect_. This was fine with Shakes, who had not slept the entire night and looked forward to taking a rest aboard the relatively luxurious larger submarine.

With the _Gnat_ attached, Percy had the _Prospect_'s diesels shut down, and they submerged to 20 meters. It was much quieter underwater, with no noise but the gentle hum of the electric motors. But they continued to send out a ping every ten minutes or so to avoid the submerged wrecks, which occasionally hung bow- or stern-down hundreds of meters into the water.

On passive sonar, Cassandra listened to the sound of the _Prospect_'s motors traveling off into the water and come bouncing back. From the signals, she felt the impenetrable surface above and tracked the larger pieces around her in their orbits through the gyre. She spent the first few hours of the morning scanning circles with the sonar, flipping filters on and off. 

When she felt like she had found a good combination of filters for giving her the clearest view of the surrounding water --- while at the same time taking out the source sound of the _Prospect_'s motors --- she did a slow sweep in every direction, scribbling notes on a pad as she went. Toward the rear port side, she thought she could hear something oddly mechanical. She adjusted her filters and tried to pin it down, but it eluded her. It may have been the distant thrum of a motor, but it also could just be chunks of refuse grinding against each other. The sea was so full of signals and reflections that beyond her immediate surrounding landscape it was impossible to be sure what was real and what was just an acoustic mirage.

[//]: # (### moving through the garbage patch the next day, confirmation that the Grackle is following them again)

Throughout the day they slowly proceeded through the gyre. The active-sonar pings lit up the surroundings for Cassandra. Yet she continually faced her own doubts: about her ability to detect objects in the water, about the directional guidance she was suggesting to Hemi and Percy, and about that occasional far-off machine noise that suggested she was not quite running down every signal to its fullest extent. But every time her doubts came up, Hemi asked her to send out another ping, and each of those pings came back with such a concrete depiction of what surrounded them that her doubts would melt away with the fading sound of the ping.

By the end of the day, Cassandra's confidence was growing as she realized that sonar was becoming second-nature to her. She closed her eyes, and her mind would travel out into the water. All blackness at first. But she would relax and open her mouth slightly to minimize the sound of her own breathing. Her heart slowed. Her mind searched the water. Turning the directional wheel, she found she could follow the direction in her mind as if she were seeing out through the microphones. She no longer needed to look at the directional indicator to know whether the mics were oriented to the front, sides, or rear of the boat, she just _knew_, even with her eyes closed. The black pitch of the deep sea fell away, and in her mind it lit up around her with a midday brightness that was entirely contained within her small skull. She watched the landscape with patience, like someone sitting in a rocker on a mountaintop porch. In her mind's eye she could see with astonishing clarity the objects that dotted the landscape: the smoothly curving walls of the hulls like the bodies of lanced leviathans, the crenelations of the superstructures, the sharply defined spaces between the refuse pieces. And from below, nothing. Always nothing.

With confidence came a love of her job, and the long shift that Percy was currently asking her to do without breaks seemed like less of a burden than it had in the past. She found time passed rapidly when her mind was out there swimming in the sea of sound.

By the clock, it was just after dark when Percy suggested they might want to move up to periscope depth and have a look around at the garbage patch from the surface. The _Prospect_'s batteries were about half discharged, and if it was safe to run on the surface, they could run the diesels and recharge the batteries as usual. She asked Cassandra to have one last listen before she started raising the boat. Percy shut down the motors entirely so Cassandra could hear as far as possible.

In this complete silence, Cassandra swung the sonar mics slowly in a full circle around, listening to the sounds of the ocean in every direction. As the mics came around towards the rear of the boat, that soft far-off motorized sound arose again, floating up from the depths of the silence.

Suddenly all her doubts came flooding back, and Cassandra felt her ears go warm inside the headphones. She instinctively knew that motor off in the water was _Grackle_. Still behind them, still pursuing, perhaps never having left. She also knew that she should have known it was their pursuers when she heard the first faint wavering contact hours ago in the early part of the day. She realized she had made a mistake, potentially a large one, and that made her afraid to say anything.

She listened to the sound for a few minutes, only just barely easing the directional wheel back and forth across the signal with the tip of a shaking finger, trying to lock in on the strongest bearing. It was only when Hemi put his heavy hand on her shoulder that she realized that he had been standing behind her, watching. Even without hearing, it was possible for him to read the gauges and knew she was on something. Cassandra looked up at him. She wrestled down her fear about the mistake she had made.

She slipped a headphone off one ear. "Something's there, Hemi."

"It does look like it, does it not?" he said. "Let me listen." He picked up the second headset and adjusted the gain. He paused for a second, then flipped a couple of filters on and listened again.

"That's them, isn't it Hemi?" Cassandra asked. "I...I think I heard them earlier."

Hemi nodded as he patted Cassandra's shoulder again. "Sylvia!" he bellowed upward as he stepped back, stretching out the wire of the headset. He looked up through the hatch to the control room. 

Percy squatted on her haunches, her face a meter above Hemi's. "What the fuck is it this time?"

"The _Grackle_...it is back again."

"Sweet motherfucking fuck! Why? Why are they still fucking after us? We. Have. No. Fucking. Cargo." She breathed for a few seconds through her nose. "How far away are they?"

"The contact is faint and distant. That is why Cassandra did not hear them before." His eye caught Cassandra's grateful face. "They are far enough away that the active ping is not returning a distance to them --- or at least the active unit cannot sort it out from all the other objects in the water."

"But the pinging we've been doing has probably been leading them along through this garbage patch I fuckin'  mistakenly believed would provide us cover --- like fucking breadcrumbs through some fucking black forest. Fuck me!"

"_Round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round perdition's flames_..." Hemi said quietly to himself.

But Percy heard him quite clearly. "Oh, so the _Prospect_ is the fucking white whale now?"

He looked up at her. "You must admit, there is almost a kind of classic literary insanity to their actions."

"You stifle that fucking tendency of yours toward layered meanings right fucking now, Hemi Howell. Whenever you do that, it gives me the same crawling-nauseated feeling as sticking my hand in a toilet bowl full of unflushed shit. The ocean is plenty fucking dramatic enough without having to spread some kind of pretentious icing of bullshit modern literary sludge on top of it...alright? Now, are they gaining on us? How long before we have to start worrying about them putting a torpedo in the water?"

"No way to tell just yet. They likely have the same difficulty as us --- moving fast through the surface garbage puts them at risk of hitting something."

"On the other hand, they have a giant fucking ram mounted to the front of their fucking ugly-ass sub. Perhaps they have no fucking fear at all of plowing through any heavy obstacle before them. With that in mind: we run like the fearful little mammalian prey we are. We remain submerged! Bastian, seven knots. Fuck! No, wait. Gregory --- first go find fucking Shakes and get that leeching boat of his detached from my girl."

[//]: # (### They are pursued through the night)

Twenty minutes later there was a clunk from the depths of the _Prospect_ as the _Gnat_ detached. Bastian eased the throttle forward slightly and the sounds inside the boat responded with a slightly increased pitch. The difference in speed was not significant, and most of the crew did not detect their increased velocity through the water. 

[//]: # (------ FEB 2025 EDITED TO HERE; use :WF and pablo in console, desert, shine and moria, or paper in gvim ------)
 
But Percy could. To her it felt like her boat was now tearing through the deep, and the terror of what may be hanging down from the surface directly in her path made her break out in a cold sweat that did not evaporate in the cool, damp air of the control room.

For the first half of the night, they kept up the active pings. Percy traded the assurance of a clear path for the fear that each ping almost certainly allowed the _Grackle_ to continue to track them. 

As the night wore on though, Hemi and Cassandra's careful measurements of the strength of the _Grackle_'s sonar signal suggested the _Prospect_ was not going to gain any distance on their pursuers while the pinging continued. In fact, it seemed they might be losing ground.

The hours droned by with unchanging regularity. Hemi and Cassandra felt their minds softening with the persistence of the noise in their headsets. While Percy desperately needed every member of her crew, she also could not have them making bad decisions from lack of sleep. So after midnight she insisted that Hemi and Bastian hit the rack, with Cassandra and Gregory scheduled for a few hours in their bunks later in the night. She had no intention of sleeping herself.

When Percy inspected the page on the clipboard next to Cassandra's sonar unit, she found it was rapidly filling up with notations describing the objects the active sonar was reflecting back, and the signal strength of the submarine following behind. Percy willed the _Prospect_ on, trying desperately to get Cassandra's numbers to add up to some more distance between herself and that dogged signal out there in the water. But the numbers eased ever closer together, and she knew it was only a matter of time before the _Grackle_ would be within torpedo range. That sub's commander must have known it too, because he did not increase speed, preferring to slowly reel his target in with minimal risk to his own boat. Given how quickly he had jumped to taking risks to gain an upper hand on the _Prospect_ in the past, the patience the _Grackle_'s commander was currently showing telegraphed to Percy his unnerving confidence in the coming demise of her boat.

In the middle of the night, Percy came down to the sonar compartment to check on the numbers once again. Cassandra showed her that the list of signal strengths had steadily increased with the closing of their pursuers. Percy broke out in another cold sweat, this time from the fear of the torpedo that she now realized could be released at any second. The _Grackle_ was rendering more clearly on the active sonar readouts --- it had crept within ten nautical miles.

Almost regretting it as she said it, Percy asked Cassandra to lay off the active pings and use only passive sonar to track objects in the water. It would be challenging given the density of objects fouling the space they were moving through, but at seven knots the _Prospect_ was putting out just enough noise that a good sonar operator should be able to clearly see the surrounding seascape for miles in every direction. Hemi's faith in Cassandra's natural skills was rubbing off on Percy.

With the active sonar off, Cassandra soon reported that the _Grackle_ had slowed and was losing some distance. Percy knew exactly what the cause of that was --- they had to run slowly and more quietly to hear the _Prospect_'s engine noise now.

[//]: # (### They hit an obstruction in the water)

For the next two hours, Cassandra blearily focused on listening to the sonar contacts while shouting potential hazards in the water up to the control room. Gregory and Percy were required to constantly adjust their course to avoid one large object or another that rang out in Cassandra's earpieces. But she could not hear the smaller objects, and every so often one would bump threateningly against the hull, loud enough for them all to hear it regardless of which part of the ship had been struck. Every time this happened Percy shouted a string of curses down to Cassandra, and the oaths were ever fiercer and longer-lasting.

By the time Hemi arrived back in the sonar compartment from his rack, Cassandra was clearly frayed. He consulted with her briefly to get caught up, and he knew he would need to relieve her. But first he wanted to check in with Percy, so he climbed to the control room. 

While he was on the ladder, the crunching sound of an impact --- a recapitulation of the sound they all heard the first time the _Grackle_ had rammed them --- shook the _Prospect_ bow to stern.

"Gregory! Reduce speed to two knots!" Percy shouted almost instinctively. 

As the boat slowed, Percy's next thought was that they had in fact been rammed again --- that Cassandra had not heard the _Grackle_ charging at them. "Cassandra you little shit! You let them hit us!"

"No, Captain Percy!" Cassandra wailed with the deep-grained panic of someone who knows they had made a mistake. "It definitely wasn't them! They're still miles and miles off."

Percy looked down at Hemi, who still clung to the ladder, his huge stony form held by hard, tensed muscles. "Hemi, you get that little fucking whore off my sonar immediately and tell me what the fuck is going on with my boat!" 

Hemi slowly lowered himself to the deck of the sonar compartment, and nodded to Cassandra. She stood, wobbly on her feet, and handed him the sonar headset. Hemi looked towards the hatch that led to the crew quarters and Cassandra followed his eyes, first with her own eyes and then her whole body. She disappeared silently below decks.

Hemi put the sonar headset on and listened closely for a minute. "It was just a derelict...Cassandra was right, the pursuing sub is still close to ten miles behind us."

"She still fucked us, Hemi. A competent operator would have fucking heard that derelict coming on."

"She was just tired, Sylvia. She had been at the sonar station for nearly twenty hours. You or I could have made the same mistake in that condition."

"I can't use her in critical fucking situations, Hemi. It's too fucking risky."

Hemi did not reply.

Bastian was coming through the hatch into the sonar compartment when Gregory reported to Percy that the _Prospect_ was losing buoyancy in the bow again. Subconsciously, Percy had already known it through the shift in the angle of the deck under her boots, but the thought had yet to register itself in the conscious part of her mind.

Percy looked down and saw Bastian standing at the foot of the ladder to the control room. "Bastian, get up here. Gregory, before you hit the rack, go down to the fucking cargo hold and check on our welded split in the pressure hull --- fucking money is that it has opened up yet again, with that last little boneshaker."

A few minutes later Gregory's voice came crackling over the PA speaker above Percy's head in the control room. *"Fuck, Captain Percy, you're right. Those welds are failing. There's already about a foot of fucking water in the bilge."*

"Fuck me again!" said Percy. She leaned over the trim control panel and flipped on the forward bilge pumps and slid the power controllers up to maximum. As the bilges ramped up, the higher-pitched hum of their small but powerful electric motors passed through the hull and lay down on top of the bass hum of the main drive motors. Bastian looked up at Percy with a dubious look, but did not voice his doubt.

"Sylvia," Hemi's voice floated up from below, "whatever hope we have of the _Grackle_ not tracking us is removed if you run the bilge pumps at max like that."

"Well, we're not going to fuck around with sinking again, Hemi. I've had too many close calls with getting sucked down the hole recently. We'll just have to figure out some other fucking tactic."

For the next few hours Hemi carefully tracked the pursuing sub on sonar. He grew ever surer that the _Grackle_ was back on the _Prospect_'s track and was gaining ground once again. Percy nervously watched the battery gauges as the needles dipped slowly down into the areas marked with red cross-hatching. The relatively fast speed they had kept up now combined with the added draw of the bilge pumps to leave them with terrifyingly little battery power.

Percy had run out of ideas though. She just let the _Prospect_ run, leaning her weight from an overhead strap while she smoked. Hemi continued directing Bastian to make occasional adjustments to steer clear of dangerous objects in the water.

It was just starting to seem to Percy that perhaps there were fewer calls coming up from Hemi for course adjustments when the needles on the battery gauges suddenly dipped down into the solid red zone and then fell onto their zero needles, flat and lifeless. The sound of the electric drive motors died away with them. And just a second after that, the higher pitched whine of the forward bilge pumps died away too.

The _Prospect_ sat dead in the water.

Bastian tapped the battery gauge, a smoking cigarette propped between two long fingers on a shaking hand.

"Hemi!" Percy called down. "We've completely run the fucking batteries down!"

Hemi removed the sonar headset and stood at the foot of the ladder to the control room. "What do you want to do now?"

"I'm fucking asking you: what the fuck can we do? All we've got is hotel power! ...And we're going to fucking sink if we don't find some power to run those forward bilges real soon. Give me options!"

"You could flip over the main power to draw from the emergency hotel batteries --- but with the bilge motors running, they will deplete those batteries in a matter of an hour or so."

"No, that doesn't give us any maneuvering. Give me another option."

"We could surface, of course. Though we will never lose them with the noise we will generate running diesels, and it is almost daylight now."

"Of this I am fucking aware. But I think that's what we're fucking doing because at least we'll be moving. How much garbage is on the surface?"

"There is still a fair amount of coverage, though I do believe we have already passed through the densest mass of the patch."

"And how far behind are our fucking pursuers?"

"Fewer than ten nautical miles."

"Shit. Ah fucking well. Up we go, boys! Hemi, want to let some air into my girl?"

A few minutes later a loud hiss pushed through the boat as Hemi opened up the compressed air into the main ballast tanks. The _Prospect_ rose slowly until it bobbed with its deck awash at the surface.

[//]: # (### They run diesels on the surface, with the bilge pumps --- noisily)

Percy popped the hatch and climbed up to the bridge under a still-dark sky that was just beginning to lighten in the east. The oily water remained black around them, and bits of floating refuse and wood lay across the deck and in the water, but there were distinctly fewer of the large, shadowed ship hulls in the dimly visible sea. 

In the pre-dawn light, Percy scanned around with a pair of binoculars. Not seeing anything of note on the first pass, she circled the horizon a second time. There was nothing out there to see except the gray gradient field of the sky meeting the black field of the water.

She called below and a minute later came the familiar whine of the compressed air turning over the diesels. The engines fired and a chugging black smoke rose above the sail behind her. As the big diesels spun, she could almost feel the power flooding back into all the systems of her boat that depended on it. 

The _Prospect_ picked up speed, and the low-pressure air system soon had pumped enough into the ballast tanks to fully surface the boat, stranding pieces of refuse on the now-dry deck.

Percy put Bastian in the lookout ring and had Hemi take over at the controls of the boat. She piloted herself, constantly scanning ahead, and sometimes yelling a small course correction down to Hemi.

In half an hour, the eastern sky had lightened, but the western sky behind still pursued them with a dense blackness. With no crew to listen to sonar, they had no chance of hearing the torpedo that slipped into the water. They did not know it was there until the percussive sound of an explosion caught Percy and Bastian in the back of their heads. They spun around to find the source, and a glowing ball of orange was lifting slowly up from the surface a few miles back, a central point of sparkling light that reflected in the oily sheen and the shadowed chunks of refuse.

"Fuck," said Bastian quietly.

"What was that?" Hemi called up from the control room.

"They put a fucking torpedo in the water after us!" Percy shouted. "Looks like it hit one of the derelicts."

"This is not going to work, Sylvia. They are just going to get closer and try again," said Hemi.

"I fucking know!" She lit a cheroot and sucked at it for a long time, the lingering petroleum smell in the air blended with the harsh tobacco smoke as it made its way into her lungs. "OK. Fuck. Bastian, keep watching."

Percy climbed down to the control room, flipped off the diesels, had Hemi throttle the boat back to zero, and powered down the bilge pumps.

"To take a chance on firing from that distance, they were counting on the fact that we were making so much noise. We just got fucking lucky that there was a big steel target between us for the torpedo to find." 

She pulled on her cheroot and stared blankly for a minute.

"Without the bilges we will not remain long on the surface," Hemi broke her reverie to remind her of the other impending danger they faced.

"Go wake up Gregory and sic him on welding the fuckin' seam back together again. We'll risk taking on water until he gets the leaking slowed. Are we still in touch with Shakes?"

"He checked in over the ship-to-ship maybe ten minutes ago. He should still be in range," Hemi said as he climbed down the ladder.

Percy pulled the ship-to-ship mic to her, stretching the tangles out of the cord. "Captain Shakes, are you still out there?"

*"Captain Percy,"* Shakes's voice came crackling back, *"nice to hear from you. I heard that fuckin' explosion and I thought for a second you were on your way down the hole."*

"They put a fuckin' torpedo in the water, but all they got was one of the derelicts. Listen, we're going to make like a derelict ourselves and shut everything down over here. I need you to try to confuse the situation, or they'll just fucking come right to the point where they last heard us. Make some noise, would ya?"

*"That's what I fucking do best these days,"* said Shakes. *"I'll totally throw some fucking chaos and confusion into the water. Right?"*

"Fuckin' right. Out."

A minute later the _Gnat_'s engine started. Percy could hear it without aid through the hull of the _Prospect_, though it was a quarter mile in the distance.

Hemi returned and reported that he successfully got a stumbling and groggy Gregory headed down to the cargo hold to seek out the welding gear. Percy put Hemi on sonar with a mandate to give detailed reports on the _Grackle_'s location --- as soon as the _Gnat_ had moved far enough off that they could hear anything.

[//]: # (### The Prospect hangs out silently on the surface while the sub with the ram searches)

Percy spent the next few hours in the control room, sitting in the dive planes control chair and smoking one cheroot lit off another as sea water once again seeped into the cargo hold, and the bow of her boat slipped slowly farther down into the water.

Hemi called up a report from sonar every ten minutes or so. The first hour passed quickly, with Hemi's reports describing their pursuer's continued plodding movements towards the _Prospect_'s location. But Shakes's slow, noisy run off to the southeast eventually seemed to work, and the _Grackle_ adjusted its course to follow. The _Grackle_ began moving steadily away from the _Prospect_.

At least, at first. But in another hour, Hemi's reports made it clear that their pursuers were now familiar with the tactic of using the _Gnat_ to draw them off. The _Grackle_ gave up the chase to the southeast and started to move in large, slowly searching circles. They returned to using active sonar. The pings once again unnervingly echoed through the hull of the _Prospect_ every ten minutes or so.

By the third hour, the fear of being found started to convert into the somewhat safer feeling that came with monotony. It was clear that the active sonar pinging was not helping the _Grackle_ sort through the mass of contacts that echoed back to find the _Prospect_. The _Grackle_ gave no sign that it would leave off its diligent search, but Percy began to feel more and more confident that unless they were spotted visually, the _Prospect_ could continue to play the part of the proverbial needle while the _Grackle_ dug through the haystack.

After hours alone in the empty cargo hold, standing in reeking bilge water, Gregory finally put his dripping and stinking head into the control room to report to Percy that he had successfully stanched the most substantial part of the leaking. She reached over and patted his head, and then wiped her palm on her pants. By now the bow of the _Prospect_ leaned down about five degrees. She opened a couple of valves on the trim tank control panel and let water flow into the rear trim tanks. The stern sank slowly down until the boat was level. This left the _Prospect_ at a depth where the deck was under water, but most of the sail was still dry. Percy figured floating the boat slightly deeper could only enhance the perception that it was nothing but another derelict.

[//]: # (5 degree slope on a 100 meter ship puts the bow... 6 meters under water, I believe. Good thing the sail on the Prospect is located well back on the deck.)

Long hours of this stagnant situation turned into even longer hours. While Percy believed that the most important quality in a submariner was the ability to put patience above all else, she also knew that not taking action was a kind of action. In many cases the right move for a submarine was to simply hide and wait. It was the thing a submarine was best at --- and in this world of discreet shipping, this was the reason so much cargo now crawled across the globe underwater. But the success of using hiding as a technique obviously depended entirely on having a reasonable chance of not being found. Percy's intuition told her that while they were safe for the moment, it was only a matter of time before their chances of not being found decreased to virtually nothing. She was confident the commander of the _Grackle_ would intuit the same conclusion.

[//]: # (### Hemi comes up with a plan)

Around mid-afternoon, Hemi joined Percy on the bridge of the sail. Bastian had been sent off for much-needed rest, and Gregory was temporarily covering sonar for Hemi, who needed a break to clear his mind after the endless, numbing noise. Hemi would have asked Cassandra to cover for him, but there was no way to know how Percy would react if she found Cassandra back at the sonar station.

Percy was squinting into binoculars as she scanned around the horizon. She was unused to the brightness of the ocean under high daylight. 

She heard Hemi's heavy step from the ladder onto the bridge, but she did not look away from the horizon while she spoke to him. "We have to make a move. The surface is an unnatural place for a submarine to hide. They are going to find us sooner or later."

"Having charted their search pattern, I agree. They are following an extremely systematic course, and that suggests to me that sub commander has high confidence that he will find us eventually --- and is willing to take the time to do it."

"We need to end this. We can't run and hide forever. That fucker might be under the delusion he's fighting an entrenched battle, and will go on fighting with all the deep-pocketed resources of an Authority. But we have got to get back to work. We have no margin to cover constantly operating in this fucked-up prey condition."

"I have had the same thought. And I have an idea we could try --- though I warn you that it is extremely unlikely to work."

At this, Percy lowered the lenses and looked at him. "You have another option and you have been fuckin' holding out on me?"

"_Extremely_ unlikely to work --- and likely to get us killed." He took a breath. "The magnetic warheads... I let a couple of crates slip off the palettes when they were being unloaded in Stilt City. So I have a few dozen warheads still stashed down in our cargo hold."

"You want to try to hit them with one of those fuckin' explosives?"

"The only weapon we have."

"Indeed. But how do you deliver a fucking warhead to the sub? They are just _part_ of a weapon --- as Miss Mai was so fond of pointing out to me. We can't just underhand one over the water at them."

"That where is the part of my idea that might get us killed comes in --- I propose we use the _Gnat_."

"I don't think Shakes is going to appreciate you turning his boat into a fuckin' torpedo. As small and shittily made as it is."

Hemi proceeded to lay out a plan for her that, though it had a good chance of ending with the destruction of the _Gnat_, at least did not involve intentionally blowing the _Gnat_ up. It did, however, feature using the _Prospect_ as bait. It took some convincing on Hemi's part for Percy to fully come around to the idea.

"OK. We're going to try your --- frankly, fucking insane --- plan to take out a military submarine with nothing but leftover parts hanging around my darling _Prospect_. Go ahead and get Shakes on the pigeon."

"You mean Herschel."

"I don't care what the bird's name is. Just make sure Shakes heads back this way as silently as fuckin' possible."

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### Loading the Gnat)

Hemi got Herschel launched, carrying instructions to Shakes to return to the _Prospect_ submerged and running slowly on battery power. It was going to take a while for Herschel to find Shakes, and then a while longer for Shakes to motor quietly back. Hemi figured he had a couple of hours at least to gather the things he needed.

The magnetic warheads were in the crates he had left in the cargo hold. He selected a half dozen of the least-rusty ones and hauled them to a work-table in the engine room. Each weighed about twenty-five kilograms and consisted of a cylinder containing high explosives that was about three hundred millimeters in diameter. Attached to one end of the cylinder was a small-diameter device with the switching mechanism in it, and on top of that was a big plate with a magnet that was strong enough to activate the switching mechanism, but weak enough that it was not likely to actually adhere itself to the target. The magnet was intended to be a trigger, not an attaching component.

The devices were designed to be as simple as possible, with the idea that while a complex device could have more safety features, a simpler device could be understood and thus handled safely by any idiotic naval deckhand. Details were printed right on the side of the explosives cylinder. 

Adjusting his glasses and reading this block of text, Hemi learned that the particular mix of high explosives the cylinder contained was held very stable by a cake of exoskeletons from extinct microscopic sea creatures. It could not be set off without providing power to the detonation switch and closing the arming circuit. At the same time, the explosive did not seem so finicky that it would not go off in the close presence of another high explosive. A fortunate thing, because Hemi estimated he needed to chain at least two of these devices to detonate if he wanted to blow a hole through the pressure hull of a military submarine.

He used large steel straps to join two of the cylinders together, orienting them so the magnetic trigger plates faced outwards on both ends. He tracked down some batteries in waterproof cases and wired them in as the power supplies for the triggers. In a forgotten storage compartment for parts in the engine room, he found a pile of old mechanical timed switches that could be wound up and the timer set for when they would close the circuit. He wired these into the arming circuit on each warhead.

He made three more doubled-up units like this. With two magnetic warheads strapped together, each weighed more than fifty kilograms. Then he plundered the many storage compartments throughout the boat, looking for the rest of the parts he needed: some old boat fenders, heavy line, air hoses and chucks, and his slide rule and clipboard. He wished he had some small clamps, but those were not to be found anywhere. He would have to make do with screw-tightened steel clips. So a screwdriver went on his list of things to find too.

He had gathered most of the parts he needed when he heard the bump of the _Gnat_ attaching to the bottom of the _Prospect_. By the time Percy's voice came over the PA a few minutes later to let him know Shakes was aboard, Hemi had recruited Gregory to help him move all his parts and equipment down to the _Prospect_'s battery compartment near the hatch to the _Gnat_.

As Gregory opened the hatch to see Shakes's greasy-haired visage grinning up at them, Percy's voice came back on the _Prospect_'s PA. *"Hemi, Bastian is telling me that he is tracking the _Grackle_ closing on us. He thinks they picked up the _Gnat_ and followed Shakes in."*

Still down in the _Gnat_'s control seat, Shakes could hear the PA message. "Tell Percy there's no fuckin' way, man --- I was ultra fucking slow and quiet on my approach. I could have passed through a sleeping baby's bedroom without fuckin' waking it."

"They were pinging constantly," Hemi replied, leaning over the hatch down to the _Gnat_ to accept the small package of feathers, feet, and beak that Shakes was holding up to him. "They may have simply caught you in motion and followed the only moving object in the water. It cannot be helped now. Here, Gregory, stow Herschel somewhere safe, and then help me get these parts into the _Gnat_."

"What's the fuckin' plan?" Shakes asked as he accepted some filthy old boat fenders down through the hatch and tossed them backward into the cargo space behind him.

"I am coming with you. If the _Grackle_ is coming in, we need to get the _Gnat_ off as quickly as possible. I will explain the plan on the way," said Hemi.

Hemi had Shakes swap places with him, and standing down in the _Gnat_ he received the heavy explosive units that a straining Gregory and Shakes lowered down to him. After that, it took only a matter of minutes to pass down all the remaining odds and ends into the smaller boat.

With everything aboard, Shakes climbed down and joined Hemi in the _Gnat_.

"I hope you didn't fuckin' forget anything," Shakes said, looking at the pile of what appeared to be fundamentally garbage in the middle of his boat's cargo space.

"If we need anything else, I am sure the copious bounty of the _Gnat_'s hold will provide," Hemi replied.

Shakes grinned. 

"If y'all have everything, I'm going to seal these fuckin' hatches," Gregory called down from the _Prospect_.

Hemi shuffled his big body forward in the cramped space and looked up at Gregory. "Handsome Gregory, may you always remain at least as attractive as you are today," said Hemi.

Gregory reached out his hand, and Hemi lifted one meaty mitt to meet it. Shakes watched them shake.

"Don't fuckin' die down there, Captain Shakes," Gregory said, angling his head so his voice reached back to where Shakes was standing.

"If I do, take care of fuckin' Herschel!" Shakes called back as Gregory seated and sealed the _Gnat_'s hatch.

Shakes shimmied forward and slithered into the _Gnat_'s control seat. He unclipped one of the bigger wrenches from his hip and gave the hatch above his head a ringing double-tap to let Gregory know they were about to disconnect. As his hand with the wrench came down, he put out a finger and snapped open the switch that connected the circuit to the docking clamps. It was immediately followed by a low thump from the outside of the _Gnat_'s hull.

Hemi was still wedged into the small space next to the control chair. "If you're going to take up that space there, big guy, would you mind workin' the fuckin' trim? Give us a bit o' flood if you don't mind."

Shakes had left the _Gnat_ a little over-buoyant while it was attached to the _Prospect_, so even with the docking clamps disengaged, the boat's mating collar was still pressed firmly against the _Prospect_'s. Hemi twisted open a valve and they could hear water pouring into the _Gnat_. Only seconds later, the boat dropped a meter or two. Shakes gave the electric motor some throttle. Most of the dials in front of the two men suddenly came to life, their little fingers of fate wagging at them.

*"_Gnat_, _Gnat_. You boys fuckin' listening?"* Percy's voice lit up the ship-to-ship radio.

Hemi closed the trim tank valves and picked up the ship-to-ship mic from where it hung in front of Shakes. "We have you, Sylvia."

*"I couldn't let you two shitheads just go off and try this dumb-ass fuckin' idea of yours without a proper send-off, Hemi."*

"Uh, Hemi," Shakes put in, "when are you going to fill _me_ in on the details of your 'dumb-ass fucking idea' here? I'm not so sure I'm likin' the fuckin' vibe I'm gettin' from the rest of yer crew."

Percy's voice came back over the ship-to-ship. *"How does your inhumanly calculating mind put the odds that this plan will actually fuckin' work?"*

Hemi held up a finger to Shakes. "Frankly, I give it about one chance in five," Hemi said into the mic.

*"And what are the chances that you will blow up either the _Gnat_ or the _Prospect_ or both?"* asked Percy.

"At least one of the two boats? I would say one chance in four."

"One in fuckin' four?!" shouted Shakes.

"But I also think it is very likely that one way or another the plan will bring this pursuit to an end," Hemi continued, still talking to the _Prospect_.

*"Counting blowing us up as one way the pursuit could end?"* asked Percy.

"That is right." Hemi paused for a second before continuing. "I would like to also point out that this plan has a better chance of succeeding if you put Cassandra on sonar again."

*"No fucking way Hemi. I'll grant you that she has learned fast enough to be perfectly capable of doing the sittin' sonar watch job I hired her for --- I was the first to see her fuckin' potential, you know --- but in this situation where we live or die, depending on what the sonar operator hears...nope. That little shit stays in her fucking rack."*

"Have you not noticed that with me on the _Gnat_ you are down yet another crew member? You are running a full-sized hundred-meter cargo sub with a crew of four --- and that is including Cassandra. During the wars, a boat the size of the _Prospect_ would have had a crew of seventy."

*"I'll put Bastian on sonar. It will be fucking fine."*

"You need Bastian to run the trim tanks and Gregory to steer the boat. You need to keep yourself free to think about tactics --- tactics are what will make this plan successful, or not." Hemi paused. "Besides, Cassandra can do this."

There was silence from the radio for a minute. Then: *"Alright Hemi. It's your fuckin' plan, I fuckin' defer to you. I'll put her back on sonar. If she kills us all, just know my last thought will be that you were fucking wrong."*

"I can die with that."

*"Seriously. Do your fuckin' best _not_ to die if you fuckin' please. Out."*

Hemi hung the mic back on the hook.

[//]: # (### The Gnat runs on the surface; leads the _Grackle_ away)

"Bring us up to the surface," said Hemi when Shakes looked at him doubtfully. "The first thing we have to do is try to confuse that _Grackle_ into following the _Gnat_, even if for just a short while. We are not ready to use the _Prospect_ for bait...yet."

"The _Prospect_ is going to be the fuckin' bait for the _Grackle_? What kind of fuckin' plan is that?" 

"Bear with me. We need to get the _Gnat_ into position, and I need to prepare some things. Then we will go over the plan."

"OK. To the surface and running on diesel it is." Shakes gave the _Gnat_ a little more throttle while peering through the small viewport in front of him. He turned the steering yoke and drove the _Gnat_ silently out from under the _Prospect_ for a few hundred meters, then pulled back and the little submarine rose until the bow poked softly through the oily ocean surface.

"We're on the fuckin' surface." Shakes turned around in the pilot's seat to get Hemi's attention, who had moved rearward to sort the gear in the hold. "Can you switch the drive from the electric motor to the diesel? The levers are just back there behind the fuckin' engine."

Hemi squeezed past the diesel engine that took up most of the interior deck-space in the rear third of the little submarine. There he found a series of levers that stuck up from the deck. He had to take a minute to read the hand-written labels, but it rapidly made sense to his mechanically-inclined mind. The system had a clutch, so switching between the power sources to the propeller could be made without stopping the boat. Hemi threw out the clutch lever, moved the selection lever over to the diesel, and let the clutch back in.

"OK, looks like it should be on diesel drive now," Hemi called forward.

"Fuckin' sweet. There's a starter button for the diesel just above the levers; can you press and hold that until the diesel fires?"

Hemi pressed the slick rubber-coated button down with the fat part of his thumb, and the diesel engine in front of him made a few reluctant whines as it turned and the glow plugs warmed up. 

[//]: # (The Gnat has glow plugs to start it, not compressed air --- it was a tractor engine)

But before the engine fired, Shakes interrupted him. "Wait! Hemi, fuckin' wait!"

Hemi let his thumb off the starter button and the whine died away.

Shakes joined him a second later. "I almost fuckin' forgot! After the diesel starts, I won't be able to hear a fucking thing up there. Here..." Shakes unclipped the largest of the crescent wrenches from his belt and handed it to Hemi. "If you need to get my attention with the engine running, whack that against some metal part of the boat."

Hemi nodded as Shakes grinned at him and slammed his thumb down on the starter.

Hemi knew it would be loud. But he was not prepared for the sheer penetrating amplitude of the over-powered engine, which had no muffler to speak of. It rolled and roared its way to life, and the pressure of the sound swamped the entire interior of the small craft from bow to stern.

Being direct drive, unlike the _Prospect_, the _Gnat_'s engine also shook the boat a lot more. Also unlike the _Prospect_, the _Gnat_'s diesel changed pitch and volume as the boat gained speed and the engine had to work harder. Shakes pushed the throttle forward and the already all-consuming sound grew, clawing its way into the deepest folds of Hemi's tweed clothing until the bass notes vibrated his clothes against his skin, resonated in the huge void of his chest, and shook every last tiny screw holding the _Gnat_ together.

Hemi squeezed himself into the small space next to the pilot's seat where Shakes was guiding the boat. In that space he could reach the sonar controls, which Shakes had set up close enough to the pilot's seat so that normally he could work the sonar himself while driving the boat. With Hemi aboard, he was happy to let someone else keep an eye on the sonar.

Hemi did not even bother with the headset. There was no way they would hear anything on passive sonar above the raucous engine noise of the _Gnat_'s diesel. But he punched the active sonar ping button and it was loud enough to get a response. The sonar sweep laid out a speckled ground plan of contacts in the ten nautical miles or so around the _Gnat_. Hemi waited five minutes and then fired off another ping. Only one dot had changed position, and that was the _Grackle_. It had moved from its intercept course with the _Prospect_ and swung around to follow the engine noise of the _Gnat_.

[//]: # (A ground plan of _Hell_ of course. )

A few minutes later Hemi let go one more ping just to be sure the _Grackle_ was still following the _Gnat_, which it was. Then he powered down the sonar unit. Any further pings would run the risk of giving away the position of the _Prospect_ to the _Grackle_ after Percy started maneuvering her boat. For the time being, with the _Gnat_'s engine overwhelming everything else in the water, Hemi would have to just guess the status of the other boats by dead reckoning.

Hemi caught Shakes's eye and pointed up to the hatch. Shakes nodded and squeezed off the other side of the pilot's seat. Hemi passed through the space of the vacated pilot's chair to climb up and open the hatch above. He stepped out into the shallow stream that washed over the deck of the _Gnat_.

The surface was mostly calm, with a light breeze under a bright gray sky. With the hatch open, Shakes piloted the boat standing. With his head up out of the sail, he kept a fierce eye forward for large pieces of debris or sunken hulks. Hemi shaded his eyes and scanned the horizon behind. They had only made a couple of miles from the _Prospect_, and Hemi could still see its gray sail rolling slowly from side to side, outlined dimly against the cloudy sky. But it was just one of a half dozen other large inert masses bobbing on the ocean surface within eyesight, not to mention the hundreds of smaller bits slowly churning through the scummy black water and occasionally clacking against each other. 

Hemi sat on the _Gnat_'s low sail, just astern the open hatch and in front of the diesel exhaust that blew away abaft in a long stream of airborne crud. Shakes reached down into the sail, withdrew a pair of binoculars, and handed them to Hemi. 

Hemi could see nothing moving under power on the surface besides themselves, which meant the _Grackle_ was probably operating submerged. As with everything to do with submarining, Hemi's plan would be a series of long, slow moves, interspersed with fast and frightening determined actions.

Hemi scanned back and forth across the horizon for twenty minutes or so, and then a small aspect change of the _Prospect_'s sail caught his practiced attention. It had stopped swaying, and was now holding itself bolt upright. Hemi focused his binoculars on it, and a few minutes later it sank silently downwards. The viscous black surface closed over it with a sucking sound that Hemi almost imagined he could hear.

[//]: # (### The Gnat dives; assembling the devices; the plan)

At this, Hemi signaled to Shakes to make way so he could climb back down into the bowels of the _Gnat_. He returned to assembling the devices he had been working on. He made careful calculations with his slide ruler and noted them on his clipboard. Then he connected an air hose to a valve of the _Gnat_'s compressed air system and blew air into the old boat fenders he had brought from the _Prospect_. After each fender was filled, he put a gauge on it and checked the precise pressure inside the fender. When he was satisfied with the level of inflation, he sealed the fender shut with a screw-tightened clip and then lashed it to one of his twin explosive cylinder mine units.

The resulting device was crude, but Hemi trusted the numbers on his clipboard and the fundamental simplicity of the weapons he had created.

Another hour had passed as he worked, and Hemi intuited that it might be time to check on the _Grackle_. He lifted the big crescent wrench and smacked it against the hull of the _Gnat_ with all his might. Shakes lowered his head and looked around at the clanging sound that managed to creep across to him just above the racket of the diesel engine to see Hemi giving him a "kill it" gesture. Shakes gave Hemi a thumbs up and eased the throttle back. 

The sound of the engine died down enough to give Hemi a tremendous sense of relief. Shakes pointed to the engine kill button on the wall and Hemi thumbed it. True silence --- silence like Hemi had never quite experienced before in all his years on submarines --- overtook the small boat.

The silence only lasted a second before Shakes's suddenly nasally-sounding voice broke in. "What the fuck're we doin' now?"

"Take us down. As deep as the _Gnat_ can go."

"OK...then switch us back to the fucking electric motor, man. And now maybe with the quiet back on us, you can fuckin' fill me in on your apparently suicidal fuckin' plan."

"Shortly, Captain Shakes. We must check the sonar first, and I am sure you can appreciate the pragmatism of that order to things."

Hemi pulled the levers in reverse order from before to disengage the drive from the diesel and re-engage the electric motor. Unlike the diesel, the electric motor did not have to be started, of course. Shakes just pushed the throttle forward and the much softer hum of the electric drive motor increased in pitch along with the slight sense of acceleration.

Hemi stepped forward and powered up the passive sonar unit. He lifted the headset from the welded steel peg from which it hung and put it on. He listened to the quiet ocean around them. He could not hear the _Prospect_ at all --- Percy must be running very slowly. But swinging the mics around, he found the _Grackle_ easily --- a few nautical miles off to the west of the _Gnat_. Even though the pursuing sub had to be much further away than the _Prospect_, and even though they were running submerged on electric motors, the _Grackle_ was running fast enough to be easily tracked. They did not care who knew where they were.

It took Hemi about fifteen minutes of listening to get a grasp on the situation. The _Grackle_ had given up the pursuit of the _Gnat_, probably not long after Shakes and Hemi had started the engines. Hemi assumed they had quickly realized the _Gnat_ was once again playing a decoy. But the _Gnat_'s run had apparently thrown just enough confusion into the water for the _Grackle_ to have lost their bead on the _Prospect_. They had taken up a search pattern again, and Hemi tracked them turning through a multi-mile diameter circle as they looked for the _Prospect_. They were pinging regularly, so if Percy was moving, there was a good chance they would find the _Prospect_ soon.

Hemi pulled back one earpiece and turned to Shakes. "There is not much time. Give us all the speed the _Gnat_ has got underwater. We have to get between the _Grackle_ and the _Prospect_."

[//]: # (No more oaths, from here to the end.)

"Ya, OK, Hemi. But...now you absolutely have to tell me what the plan is."

"Well..." Hemi lowered the headset so it sat around his thick neck and made a wide gesture towards his devices piled up in the _Gnat_'s rear cargo space. "The plan is pretty simple, really. I intend to suspend magnetic warheads I saved from the last shipment in the water column. With some careful calculations, I hope to set them in such a way that the _Grackle_ will move into one and set it off, hopefully disabling the submarine."

"Ah," said Shakes, "so it's just a little matter of flushing one of those bad boys out the escape trunk at precisely the right depth and in the path of that big ugly sub, eh?"

"I can control the depth with the amount of air in these old boat fenders. I have calculated the pressure needed in the fenders with enough precision, I believe, so that they should float at precisely twenty-five meters deep. That should take care of the Z axis, but I need you to navigate us across the path of the _Grackle_."

"That may not be so easy."

"I am aware. I will be listening on sonar, though. I am confident the _Gnat_ can do the job."

"Well, of course this boat can _do_ it! ...I just never thought I'd be using my bug to play chicken with a full-sized full-speed foul-looking ram-headed military sub."

[//]: # (### Getting the boats and the devices into position)

Hemi put the headset earpieces back over his ears and listened closely as he slowly spun the sonar in an arc across the direction of the bow of the _Gnat_. He slowed when the microphones were pointed a little off the starboard side, and then stopped.

"Sylvia is on the move," Hemi said quietly.

"Really? Seems stupid, with that sub looking for her."

"That's the 'bait' part of the plan: she will let the _Grackle_ find her and chase her. As soon as she heard us shut down the diesel, she ramped the _Prospect_ up to something like ten knots --- to make it look as though she is trying to make a run for it."

"They are submerged?"

"Yes. We planned for the _Prospect_ to run at about thirty meters down --- that way they can move fast with less risk of hitting a derelict. But her batteries are very low. I estimate she can only maintain ten knots for perhaps twenty minutes, so we have to move quickly to put this plan into action."

Shakes leaned his hand on the throttle, but it was already pushed all the way to the forward stop. The electric motor whined steadily from behind them, driving the small boat forward with all the force it could muster.

"Come port to 227 degrees," said Hemi, with his hand cupped over the earpieces of the headphone, trying to eke out just that marginal amount more sound dampening that might be what he needed to hear some crucial thing out in the water. Shakes leaned the yoke slightly to the left and the boat heeled over in response.

"Down. Thirty meters. The _Grackle_ has clearly heard the _Prospect_'s run and matched its depth. They are lined up in pursuit a little less than five miles behind. We need to intercept their course in the next ten minutes or so, if we possibly can." Hemi lifted a stopwatch that hung from the same peg the sonar headset was stowed on and clicked it once to reset it to zero. He counted for a few seconds while listening, and then clicked it a second time to start the stopwatch. He made a note on the clipboard.

"If your plan doesn't work, Hemi, the _Prospect_ is done for. Honestly, I'm not even sure why they haven't already fired a torp."

"There are still a number of derelicts around. A torpedo is a precious thing. At the moment it is still too likely they would hit one of those garbage hulls rather than their target." Hemi looked down at the stopwatch, ticking away loudly and quickly. "I have to get ready. Do not change speed or course."

"Right."

Hemi left the headset behind on its peg, now relying entirely on the stopwatch and the unvarying speed and course of the _Gnat_ to know where he was in the water. He gingerly moved toward the stern, stepping over and around the detritus Shakes felt was perfectly reasonable to cast about in his only living space. 

He picked up one of the explosive devices. It was heavy enough that even Hemi struggled a little to lift it. In addition to the sheer weight of the two warheads strapped together, he had to manage the awkward fenders and lines that tangled themselves repeatedly around the myriad protrusions that plague the interiors of all submarines.

The escape trunk was located behind the engine and motor, so it took some effort on Hemi's part to pass one of the heavy devices through the narrow space and push it back until it was underneath the cylinder of the escape trunk that hung down from above. The escape trunk had a heavy hand-screw-sealed hatch on the bottom of the cylinder. Hemi opened the hatch and hefted the device up into the narrow interior space. 

His intention was to get the device to sit on a narrow ledge that circled the lower inside rim of the hatch, which was intended as a foothold for the person who wanted to escape to stand on while sealing the hatch from the inside. It was difficult to get the heavy warhead package to balance on it, but he did manage eventually to arrange it so it no longer tried to tilt back into the empty space over the hatch. Then he piled the excess line on top of the warhead package and stuffed the fenders in. The fenders were even more of a challenge to position so they would stay up in the escape trunk, but at least they hardly weighed anything and had no chance of exploding if dropped. He finally got the fenders to stay in the trunk by propping them on the ledge and leaning the two fenders against each other.

Finally, Hemi reached back up into the escape trunk and wound the mechanical timers that would close the circuit to arm the warheads when the timer reached zero. He set them to a frighteningly-short five minutes --- hardly enough time for the _Gnat_ to drive clear of the amount of explosive the combined warheads packed. But he could not risk the devices being unarmed when the _Grackle_ came within range of them. 

Time was compressing down on Hemi. The little mechanical timers buzzed away, their sound reverberating around inside the circular steel walls of the escape trunk. The rickety little devices strove desperately to count out their five minutes with some precision. Hemi gingerly lowered the escape trunk hatch down and spun the sealing wheel closed, which cut off the quick ticking of the timers and left him in silence.

[//]: # (### Releasing the devices; breaching the Gnat)

Hemi looked around the outside of the escape trunk for a control that would flood it. The only promising component was a massive unlabeled lever set into the top of the pressure hull above his head. 

"How do you flood the escape trunk?" he called forward to Shakes.

"Flood? Hemi, this ain't no commercial sub with some kind of specs-mandated flood-and-pump escape trunk for getting a crew of fifty off a sunk boat. The _Gnat_ has a normal crew complement of just one, so the escape trunk is a one-time use only. That big ugly lever above your head releases the escape trunk topside hatch, which is rigged with a giant spring to open it. There's another lever inside the escape trunk just like it that does the same thing. The hatch opens and the ocean pours in. That's it."

"So it cannot be reset underwater, then?"

"No way. The only reason I even put in an escape trunk was so I could flush out any problematic cargo if I got into a sticky situation with an Authority vessel. That...and I was terrified of being stuck on the bottom of the ocean and unable to open the sail hatch."

"Alright. It will have to do. Be ready, I will open the escape trunk in another minute or so."

Hemi held the stopwatch up in front of his eyes and the second hand rapidly screwed itself across the face. In his head, Hemi could see their position in the water, see where the _Prospect_ should be off to their port side, and see the _Grackle_ --- all black and fiercely toothy in the front in its way that was entirely unnatural for a submarine --- charging towards Shakes's rickety little craft from starboard. The boats all moved relative to each other in his head, driven into position by the second hand on the stopwatch. He put his hand up to the heavy iron lever covered with flecks of rust above his head.

The second hand curled around and came up level. In Hemi's head, the boats were all in the exact position. His thick fingers tightened on the lever, and then the muscles all the way down his arm to his shoulder tightened --- the lever had been resting and rusting peacefully for years.

But it budged, then gave, then swung back. From above his head came a loud clang as the escape trunk hatch snapped open and flapped back against the deck of the _Gnat_. Hemi could almost feel the intense weight of the water under the pressure of three atmospheres dropping into the escape trunk almost instantaneously. He put his ear against the trunk. Through the cold, damp steel he could hear the gentle bumping as his device lifted up and clear of the trunk.

"The device is away, Captain Shakes!"

"...Are you sure about that? I'd hate to find out it's stuck in there and arming itself."

"I am as sure as I can be. Blow the tanks --- the surface is going to be the safest place for us in the next few minutes."

"Aye, boss." Shakes reached down and pulled up on the heavy red lever at his feet. The _Gnat_'s compressed air reserves blew past him in the boat's narrow pipes with a whistling hiss. Water burbled heavily out from the ballast tanks into the surrounding ocean. The _Gnat_ started upwards, slowly for a second, and then a moment later gaining speed. "Hang on to something Hemi!"

As his stomach dropped, Hemi grabbed one of the freezing pipes that ran along the hull next to him. He gripped the pipe with his hard fists, his knuckles whitening through his cracked skin. The pipe was so cold the moisture of his palms froze and his skin stuck to the metal.

Hemi had ridden upwards on submarine ballast blows hundreds of times, but the tiny _Gnat_ was a different experience from a big cargo sub like the _Prospect_. In the _Prospect_ it was a dramatic but graceful maneuver, with the power and dynamism of a calving glacier. The _Gnat_ was another matter entirely. More like a bird of prey diving on a small sparrow. The whole boat shook with the strain of it, the hull made sounds like it was cracking apart --- and it was by no means clear to Hemi that it was not. When the bow popped through the surface a second later, the boat came down hard and Hemi was forced to rip one hand from the pipe and throw it up to keep his head from being driven up into the escape trunk lever.

On the surface, the bow of the boat, which had taken on a dramatic upward angle during the ballast blow, settled slowly in front of the two men. The _Gnat_ leveled out and a sense of calm flowed through the craft. As soon as he was sure the maneuver was complete, Hemi moved rapidly past the engine and pushed in next to the sonar unit. He had the headset on and was tracking the _Grackle_ in a few seconds.

[//]: # (### The first explosion)

Shakes cut the throttle to the motor and caught Hemi's eye. He pointed to the hatch at the top of the sail with a questioning look, and Hemi nodded. Shakes lifted himself up, unscrewed the hatch, and sat up on the sail searching the flat gray water behind the _Gnat_. With little wind, there was almost no noise. Only a stifling silence, broken by nothing except the soft slap of water against the drifting hull. The sea was mottled in places with black oil that reflected back the gray of the sky, making Shakes feel like they were floating in a bath of concrete slurry.

Nothing moved under that silent dome of sky as one minute passed, then another. Shakes shaded his eyes against the brightness and scanned the water between him and the horizon line, looking for any surface manifestation of the movements going on below.

Another minute passed. And then, much closer than Shakes had anticipated, the heavy thud of an underwater explosion broke through the surface, and a plume of water, driven up and forward by explosive momentum shot upwards and dropped a gray oily rain onto the deck of the _Gnat_. The rain passed up in a rapid squall line from stern to bow, soaking Shakes where he sat on the sail.

"Ha ha! Hemi! It worked!"

"Hold on," Hemi's voice came up darkly from below. "I am tracking the sub on sonar."

Shakes's initial feeling of excitement that such a claptrap device actually functioned as intended subsided to be replaced by the more rational thought that detonating the device was one thing, while actually damaging the _Grackle_ was another. He stared into the water next to the _Gnat_ for a moment and saw a long black shadow --- endlessly long and thin, it seemed to him --- pass under his boat down in the depths below.

"The device detonated, but I am not hearing any sign that they were damaged." From where he was standing below, Hemi's voice did not reveal any sense of disappointment. "They just passed under us, still tracking the _Prospect_." 

"So that's it? An impenetrable hull?"

"They hit my explosive with their ram, which is probably a very well-reinforced part of the sub." Hemi hesitated. "We need to figure out how to deliver a charge to a weaker point."

"Yeah, and while you are pondering that tiny challenge, they are closing in for a shot on the _Prospect_."

"Hopefully Captain Percy can manage one close pass by the _Grackle_ and give us time to get another device into position. We need to get the _Gnat_ back under water."

"Hold up. Don't forget we need to reset the escape trunk first."

"How do you pump the water out of the flooded trunk?"

"Pump! Ha. Just open the bottom hatch down there, and let it run into the bilge. Then we'll turn on the bilge pumps to toss the water off the boat."

"Elegant." Hemi made his way back past the engine again, and a minute later Shakes saw the water in the escape trunk drop away into the bottom of the _Gnat_.

Shakes stepped out of the sail and leaned over the now empty escape trunk where Hemi's round, black-bearded face was looking up at him. "Maybe I should rig some kind of pump for the escape trunk," Shakes said to him, "I actually have to do that emptying maneuver more often than I like. The hatch opens sometimes while diving, just from the stresses on the hull, I guess. Drives me nuts."

"You could just fix the latch to make sure it only opens when it is supposed to," Hemi said. "When we are done with this project, I can help you with that."

"You mean if we _live_ through this quote-unquote _project_."

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)

[//]: # (### In the Prospect)

In the control room of the _Prospect_, Percy heard the detonation of Hemi's device, stripped of all but the lowest frequencies as the sound passed through miles of water and refracted through her boat's hull.

"Cassandra!" Percy shouted down to the sonar compartment. "Tell me what just happened!"

Cassandra nervously fumbled with the directional control wheel for the sonar mics and flipped filter switches on and off. "There was an explosion..."

Percy sighed. "I know that, Cassandra. But did the explosion _hit_ the _Grackle_? Is there even the smallest possible chance that ugly boat is going down right now?"

"I...I can't tell. There's nothing but silence at the moment."

"Figure it out Cassandra! I'm depending on you here."

"The explosion definitely came from the pursuing sub --- I'd say they hit Hemi's device. But..."

A full minute passed.

"But what, Cassandra? I need to know what's happening!"

Cassandra sighed. "I can hear them now. The _Grackle_ is still after us. It is definitely not sinking. As far as I can tell, it isn't even damaged."

Percy spat and lit a cheroot. "It sounded so good. I thought we'd at least have taken a bit of wind out of their sails." This, mostly to herself.

[//]: # (### Another torpedo fired at the prospect; hits derelict)

"Captain Percy!" Cassandra was shouting now. "There's a torpedo in the water! They've fired at us!"

"Stay calm, Cassandra." Percy kept her voice even. "This is important: has the torpedo acquired us? Is it pinging us? If so, we have to dive _now_. And if we dive, this plan is over."

"I don't know Captain Percy!"

"You have to work this out, Cassandra. You know what a pinging torpedo sounds like. Listen until you can see what's happening in your head. Then tell me what I need to do."

Cassandra slowly closed her eyes. The sonar earphones pumped sound into her head, and her mind passed out of the _Prospect_ and into the water. She searched around with it, looking to port, then to starboard behind the _Prospect_, passing over the dead zone where the prop wash made her deaf. She homed in on the torpedo --- a high whining electric motor just off their rear port side. She wrapped her head around it, and in her mind she could see the machine: a long, slick steel tube slipping through the water at a speed that was far faster than anything else she'd ever seen in her mind's eye through sonar. It was coming directly toward her.

It started pinging. The round ringing echo of it almost hurt her ears.

"OK Captain Percy," she said, loudly enough for Percy to hear, but keeping her voice calm, "it's pinging."

"That means it has probably armed. Now tell me if it seems like it is tracking the _Prospect_. Bastian, come port to 280."

Bastian spun the rudder control wheel and the boat listed slightly over to one side as it made its turn.

Cassandra did not hear any corresponding change to the torpedo's direction. "It doesn't seem to be tracking us, Captain Percy --- no change to direction."

"OK, it hasn't acquired us...yet. What's the range?"

Cassandra looked at the active sonar rig readout. "One-point-three miles."

"That's not very much room to play with Cap," said Bastian, nervously fingering the throttle control.

"I am aware, Bastian."

Bastian lit a cigarette and blew smoke out from one side of his mouth.

Cassandra let her mind slip out into the water again. The frequency of the torpedo's pings had increased. It seemed to Cassandra like the device was gaining confidence, more certain of its target. But what was the target?

Cassandra scanned back and forth in wider arcs around the _Prospect_ with the sonar. Then, farther off to their port side, she could hear a hole in the water. A mass that bounced back the torpedo's pings at her, and at the same time a void that sucked in her consciousness until her mind passed around and under it, and she could see the shape clearly in her head.

"Captain Percy! The torpedo is tracking a derelict!" she said.

"Are you sure?"

"Absolutely. It will hit at any..." The explosion suddenly pierced her head through her ears. She yanked the headset off, but she was too slow to save her ears from being swamped with a painful and enduring ringing.

A second later the detonation rumbled through the hull of the _Prospect_.

Percy smiled. "Nice work, Cassandra! They may not risk another torpedo on us in these waters. They wasted two already, and those things are expensive."

"Great," Gregory smirked. "So they'll just go back to trying to ram us."

[//]: # (### Cassandra finds the Gnat, they talk over ship-to-ship about the new plan)

"Cassandra, the next task is to find the _Gnat_ and figure out what Hemi is doing," Percy said.

"Right."

"And don't forget to continue to track the _Grackle_ at the same time. What's the range?"

"Two-point-three nautical miles. And they are increasing speed now."

"They're trying to close on us. Your hunch about ramming might be right, Gregory." Percy glanced at the battery gauges. They were moving fast enough at ten knots that she could see the needles on the battery-charge gauges dropping steadily. Those gauges had passed into the hatched red zone. That meant only a matter of twenty minutes or so of battery remained. After that, they would be forced to remain stationary or surface --- either way, they would be an easy target for a final ramming.

"Let's do what we can to conserve our remaining battery, Bastian; shut down the port-side wheel and spin one wheel alone. Cassandra, find the _Gnat_. Quickly!"

It was not an easy task. While the _Gnat_ created an earth-shaking amount of noise when running diesel on the surface, its small size and tiny electric motor made it nearly invisible underwater. And even though it was relatively quiet, the noise from the _Prospect_'s electric motors at this speed also drowned out most of the possibility of hearing a target as small as the _Gnat_. The only way it could be done was by carefully filtering out the _Prospect_'s motor noise, and then somehow landing the sonar mics precisely on the bearing of the _Gnat_. Cassandra flipped filters on and off and adjusted the fine-control dials carefully. Eventually she managed to limit the noise wash from the _Prospect_ enough to give her a sense that she might be able to hear her way around it.

She scanned and scanned, back and forth. All the way around the bow, too, but mostly focusing on the direction behind, where she had last heard the little boat moving. Her mind was out there, deep in the water behind her, but there was nothing but darkness. She felt like she was blind to everything except for her sense of the _Prospect_'s position, and the _Grackle_ steadily gaining on them.

Then she heard the faintest rhythmic pumping noise, off to the starboard side. It had to be mechanical, and the _Gnat_ was the only other machine in the area. She locked in on it and tracked it carefully for a minute. "I've got them, Captain Percy. Thirty meters down, almost directly off our starboard side. Range: about a quarter mile."

"Excellent. They might hear us on ship-to-ship." Percy pulled down the mic and called out into the water for Shakes.

*"_Prospect_! Captain Shakes here. I read you. Nice to hear you didn't go down with that last torp."*

"Indeed. Unfortunately, Gregory here has a theory that now the _Grackle_ is after us for another ramming. Based on the speed they've put on, I'm inclined to agree with him. So...what's the plan now?"

*"Aye. Well, Hemi says he still thinks he can take them down. He just needs to deliver one of his devices to a weaker part of their sub than the ram --- which is what they detonated the last one with."*

"And how is he going to do that?"

*"No idea. I'm just steering the boat the way the boss says. Hang on..."* A few seconds of static came across the radio, and then Shakes picked up again. *"Hemi says you should just keep running --- make evasive moves if you can. He's going to maneuver us into position to deliver a second device."*

"OK. But keep in mind we're down to maybe fifteen minutes on the battery here. As soon as that's gone, we're a dead-in-the-water target for a boat with an intention to ram."

Another second passed. *"Hemi says --- get this --- he will 'take your remaining battery into his calculations.'"*

"If anyone beside Hemi had said that to me, I wouldn't be able to take it as any kind of reassurance. Don't sink, Captain Shakes --- I need Hemi back."

*"Don't you sink either, Captain Percy --- I've gotten used to the hot meals on your boat! Out."*

As Percy hung the mic back up above her head, Bastian reached one long finger out and fruitlessly tapped the battery gauge.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### Back in the Gnat to lay the final warhead)

"Captain Shakes, we have to go deeper. Fifty meters."

"Ain't gonna happen, Hemi. The _Gnat_ was built at altitude! The heart of the boat is in the sky, not underwater."

"That's a somewhat odd sentiment for a submarine."

"Below thirty and the seams start splitting. Fifty is out of the question."

"If we lay the mines shallow, the _Grackle_ hits them head on. As you could see from the first device, the ram essentially acts as heavy plated armor. We are not going to do any damage if their boat hits the mine with the ram. If we can get the device _under_ their boat, though --- if we can get it to detonate right in the middle of their sub --- the upward force of the explosion will blow through the middle and break the sub's back. Snap it in half. And all the watertight compartments in the world will not help them at that point. At least, in theory."

"That sounds to me like the _Gnat_ would have to be directly under them, release the mine, and have it go off almost immediately. How are we surviving that, Hemi?"

"Not quite. I will set the arming timer. We can leave the mine under their path, and if I get the timing correct, the weapon will arm just as the middle of the sub passes over it --- and detonate immediately. We would have a few minutes at least to move the _Gnat_ to safety, probably to the surface again."

"You can calculate the timing that precisely?"

"I believe so. It is just a refined use of dead reckoning."

"Never was very good at reckoning the dead myself."

"All you have to do is drive the boat, Captain Shakes."

"...Down beyond a depth I never intended to take it."

Hemi pounded on one of the roughly welded thwarts. "It is a good boat. I think it is capable of more than you give it credit for."

"I'd have more faith in that statement if it came at a time when you were not trying to convince me to do something incredibly, suicidally stupid with the _Gnat_."

Hemi grinned and patted Shakes on the shoulder. He picked up the sonar headset and put one earpiece over his ear. After a second of listening, he gave Shakes a new course. "Come left to 330. That will put us on an intercept with the _Grackle_ again." Hemi started his stopwatch.

It was natural that any person piloting the _Gnat_ could not help but look out the small viewport set into the sail at eye level. After aligning the bow of the boat to 330, and pushing the throttle control all the way forward, Shakes's eyes peered out into the murky water, and scanned upwards. There was nothing to see, but Shakes could never resist the temptation to try.

"Ten minutes," said Hemi, speaking softly, since he was less than a meter from Shakes's head. "We need to start descending now."

"Just curious Hemi, how deep do you think it is here?"

"More than a thousand meters. All we are asking the _Gnat_ to do is swim a bit deeper in the very top layer of all that water. No big deal."

Shakes patted the cold rusting steel of the hull closest to his head. "Boat, you're the only thing that can keep us from being sucked into that hole under us. It wants us, I can feel it --- but you're a good little boat, even Hemi says so. You're just the tool to keep us above that pit." With this clandestine blessing, he pushed the yoke forward and the _Gnat_'s little dive planes responded by angling downward.

They gained depth quickly, and almost immediately the hull of the _Gnat_ began to groan with the stress of it.

"Forty meters."

"The boat is doing great, Shakes."

Crackling sounds snapped and echoed from somewhere in the forward compartment.

"_Captain_ Shakes. And tell the boat, not me, man." Shakes's hands were sweating. He put a cigarette to his lips but forgot to light it.

Hemi stared at his ticking watch.

"Forty-five meters."

"OK, start leveling out," said Hemi. "I think you can stay just above fifty. I have to go prep and load the mine." Hemi listened for one second longer to the sonar, checked his stopwatch, and sidled back to load the second device into the escape trunk. 

The _Gnat_ clearly did not like being this deep. It moaned and snapped and gave every impression of being on the verge of imploding. Hemi reassured himself that he had been in lots of boats that were just "noisy" when they went deep --- though apparently perfectly sound. Some boats just liked to be vocal, letting their operators know the stress they were suffering like whiny children. On the other hand, those were professionally-built boats designed by engineers. Those boats just happened to have a few idiosyncrasies. Hemi could not shake off the knowledge that this boat was built by...Shakes. It was _all_ idiosyncrasies.

Only a minute later, both Hemi and Shakes knew it was not just the _Gnat_ being vocal. There was water in the bilge and it was rising. They could hear it sloshing around. Somewhere in the _Gnat_, the seams were leaking.

"Better hurry Hemi. I'm not sure how much longer we can stay this deep."

Hemi looked at the stopwatch. "Three minutes. Just hold the boat right at the level and speed you have --- do not let anything change."

Hemi had stuffed the explosive cylinders, fenders, and lines of the second device up into the still-wet escape trunk. He quickly scribbled calculations on his pad, made adjustments to his slide-rule, looked at the stopwatch, and came to a solution. He reached up and set the timers on the explosive cylinders. "I hope that is correct," he said to himself, and sealed the device into the escape trunk.

"Thirty seconds!" Hemi called forward. He put his hand on the lever. The hand of the stopwatch ticked around, climbing upwards. It hit the zero mark. Hemi hefted the lever that released the escape trunk hatch. It slid easily back this time. 

It took a second for Hemi to realize that was because the hatch above him did not open.

"That hatch is not open!" Hemi yelled forward, true panic slipping into the baritone of his voice.

"The pressure, Hemi! The entire hull is compressed. The hatch must be wedged in its seat!"

Hemi smacked a heavy fist against the hull above him. 

Shakes could hear the pounding in the pilot's seat. "Hemi. You have to get that open. We can't have that weapon arm itself in the trunk..."

"I am aware of that!" Hemi pressed his lips together, concentrating on revising his estimates of where the boats were in relation to each other, and at the same time trying to figure out a way to release the hatch. "Come shallow by a few meters," Hemi shouted forward, "that might be all we need." A second went by, and Hemi knew they were getting out of position. "You also need to come port to two-two-two. Hard! Now!"

The boat leaned over dramatically as Shakes turned the yoke left all the way to its stop. At the same time the bow rose slowly in response to his gentle backwards pull on the yoke.

Hemi pounded and pounded against the hull. He slid the release lever in and out uselessly. "No throttle! We have to release it right here!"

Shakes pulled the throttle back to the zero mark, and the boat drifted. Hemi picked up the crescent wrench and smacked the hull repeatedly until he left dents. Sweat beaded at his temples and his face went red with a deep anger rarely seen on his calm features. He let out a yell that frightened Shakes to his core. 

Hemi gave one final smack against the release lever with the wrench.

He heard a pop, and water falling into the escape trunk. Hemi quickly leaned over and slapped his ear against the damp steel of the escape trunk. He could hear the mine bumping as it lifted away out of it. "It opened! Full throttle! Any direction! Get us away from here!"

[//]: # (### The _Grackle_ is exploded; the Gnat is sinking)

The electric motor behind Hemi wound up to speed, and the sudden acceleration almost rolled him off his feet.

Shakes lowered his head and tried to see up through the tiny viewport. Above the _Gnat_, the water was lighter. He saw a dark shadow pass through the light. 

"Blow the tanks!" Hemi yelled from the rear of the sub.

Shakes pulled the lever, and the gust slammed through the boat. Through the viewport, he saw a worrying string of bubbles pouring from near the bow. 

The depth gauge did not move. 

Shakes tapped the gauge. He pushed the lever down, and pulled it up again, hard. Shakes believed deeply that with mechanical things you sometimes just had to get physical.

Nothing happened.

"No-go, Hemi," Shakes said with some kind of doomed resolve reflecting in his voice. "We must have cracked the ballast tanks. The blow ain't doin' crap. I think we're done here."

That was when the mine detonated. Far too close to the _Gnat_ for safety. The little boat shook to its timbers, and rolled over on its side as the shock wave grabbed the _Gnat_'s small sail and yanked on it. The sound was so loud that it rang Shakes's and Hemi's ears. Whatever small cracks had opened in the seams before now split wide, and freezing black water poured in. The power blinked and went out. 

Hemi felt his way forward in the blackness, climbing over the engine. He found Shakes by feel. Shakes was laying against the sonar equipment on the side wall that was now the floor, in half a meter of water that was rising quickly.

"Emergency power. Does the boat have emergency power?" Hemi asked loudly.

"No. Kinda like I said before: we're _done_ here."

The _Gnat_ was sinking.

[//]: # (### In the Prospect, the big reveal.)

The explosion of the second device had rocked the _Prospect_. Just a sway, but enough force for Percy to start worrying about the strength of the seam in the cargo hold once again.

"Cassandra! The second detonation: I need to know the results. Now."

"Yes, Captain Percy... I'm hearing a lot of popping and crackling. Hold on..." She scanned the sonar. The soundscape was a confusing mess: massive churning bubbles of air rising towards the surface, creaking and cracking metal, rushing water ...and distant screams of terror. "Captain Percy: I'm almost certain the _Grackle_ is finished. I'm hearing nothing but...but _damage_."

Percy grinned. "I can't believe Hemi and Shakes pulled that off! One chance in five indeed." She lit a cheroot. "Cassandra! Your top priority now is to find the _Gnat_ again."

Before Cassandra could reply, the dial on the ship-to-ship unit lit up above Percy's Head. *"Sylvia..."*

Percy's eyes snapped up to the ship-to-ship. It was not the voice of Hemi or Shakes.

*"Sylvia Percy...are you leaving me to die a second time?"* The voice came riding on a background of wailing klaxons, creaking metal, and shouting men.

Sylvia slowly reached a hand up to take the mic. She thumbed the transmitter. "...Owen? ...But how?"

*"How? You mean: _how_ am I still alive? You _left_ me alive, remember?"* The radio went silent for a few seconds, then the transmission resumed. *"You _knew_ I was alive. You heard me banging on the hull, I'm sure of it. You left me on the sail of the _Prospect_, and you dove out from under me --- thinking there was no way I could survive.*

*"And I would have died in that storm, just as you expected. Probably within a matter of minutes --- except by sheer luck I washed aboard the deck of the _Grackle_... Unlike you, they opened the hatch when they heard banging."*

Percy could hear Owen breathing heavily into the mic. She squeezed the mic in her hand. "Owen, why didn't you just say something? Why didn't you raise us on the ship-to-ship earlier? We could have done something to get you off the _Grackle_."

*"Get me _off_ the _Grackle_? The _Grackle_ was a blessing! When the hatch opened, I felt I was given a second chance. A chance I would use to clear the world of your callous ego, Sylvia, your selfish disregard. I made the _Grackle_ my tool. I'm the reason the _Grackle_ continued after you! I told them all about you: that your hold was full of weapons --- even after your delivery in Stilt City; that you were supplying rebels up and down the coast on this side of the ocean; that you were a crazy idealist who would stop at nothing to support the overthrow of Authority power; that you had a shipment of valuable metals aboard and would make for the fattest of prizes. I told them anything they needed to hear to keep them in pursuit."*

"Owen... I didn't know..." Her thumb fell off the transmitter. The radio remained dead for a few seconds.

The radio dial re-lit. *"...The worst thing now isn't you leaving me to die a second time. I made my peace with death when you murdered me the first time. No, the worst thing is that there turned out to be no purpose to my second chance. There was no purpose to anything. Redeemed from drowning, I knew what my life was for: my story was to be left for dead, and then rise again to take you down, Sylvia. But now...now you've shown me there is no narrative. No plot. No arc. The world is nothing. Nothing but random chance, and long odds. And all of us are balanced precariously over a pit of ever-deeper nothingness that we all fall into eventually.*

*"...Everyone eventually. But for me, the pit is only a few seconds away now. Know this, Sylvia: even now if I had one last chance, one last torpedo or any weapon I could reach you with at all, I would take that shot. I'd make firing on you my last act, if that was an option given to me. But I've got nothing now. No options at all."*

The ship-to-ship radio went dark. It did not light again. Percy hung the mic up. She dropped the butt of her cheroot to the deck and crushed it under her boot heel.

Cassandra kept the sonar tracking what was left of the _Grackle_. What had been one contact was now splitting into two distinct parts. Those parts resolved themselves over a matter of a few seconds, and then Cassandra could hear the two pieces falling away from her. "Captain Percy, the _Grackle_ is in two pieces. I'm losing the contact."

[//]: # (Surprise! It was Owen all along. Or at least since the storm. In the early versions of the book, I made the motivation much more abstract --- that the commander of the Grackle was after them because Own screwed his wife; but at the same time he did not really _feel_ that, he just felt like it was his duty to be a jealous husband and so took up this chase simply because that is what society expected him to do, not because he particularly cared. I still find that idea compelling and interesting myself: How much do our actions REALLY come from our emotions, and how much are they societally determined? But test readers were universally confused by this idea, so I give the reader what they want: a straight revenge story with a twist ending. It fits better with the style of the book anyway and ties everything up in a neat narrative knot that may be unlike real life, but is very like what people want from a good story. And I think, in the end, Owen came around to a similar point of nihilism as the sub commander in the first version anyway --- just in a more narratively coherent way. I thought once maybe I could make this novel accessible and fun to read AND an art novel that probes deeper more abstract questions about human nature. I guess accessible and fun to read conquered abstraction and complexity --- at least I hope so!)

[//]: # (### Return to the sinking Gnat)

The _Gnat_ was not sinking so fast that it did not right itself first. The sucking hole under them pulled harder on the lead weights at the bottom of the boat than the rest of it. Slowly the keel was drawn, and the sail rolled back up to where it was supposed to be. 

Shakes was almost ecstatic. He started laughing. "Hemi! This is certainly _it_. But at least the _Gnat_ is going down upright! With some dignity!" He found his lighter and tried to ignite the cigarette that was somehow still hanging unlit from his lips. The cigarette was soaked and refused to light, but the glow of the flame from the lighter showed them how dire their situation was.

"Give me that." Hemi took the lighter from Shakes and snapped it aflame. He used it to look over the _Gnat_'s controls, passing the small, flickering light slowly in front of each dial and gauge. For good measure he pulled the emergency blow lever again. He opened all the tank trim valves. None of those things required electricity to function --- they were purely mechanical devices on all submarines as a safety precaution for a situation just like this. If there was no power, the sub should still be able to make it to the surface. 

But not if the ballast tanks had split and let the reserve air out. The bubble they needed to ride up had made its own way to the surface, leaving uselessly without them.

The water Shakes sat in was rising quickly. Water was pissing in through cracks in the viewport. Hemi looked at the depth gauge --- pegged at one hundred meters, which was the maximum reading for the gauge. 

He let the lighter go out.

His whole life he had been able to make these machines --- all machines --- do what he wanted them to. But this particular one was failing him now. Shakes's resignation seemed to be the only appropriate response left. In the darkness he listened the water streaming into the submarine. It sounded like babbling brooks he had known long ago in his youth, on land. With no visual sensory input in the darkness, his mind instead saw the bright sunny brooks that brought fresh water down to the sea on the island where he had grown up. All his years on rusting and leaking submarines, and running water --- a sound of death on submarines --- still remained firstly the sound of life and his youth. 

[//]: # (### Rescued by the Prospect, lifted from underneath)

Then a clang in the darkness, like a church bell in the night. Hemi had expected something like this. The pressure hull would be collapsing in on itself. The steel snapping together like the jaws of some beast. He braced himself for the rush of water that should follow it.

Instead the _Gnat_ settled flat, and the descending sensation suddenly jolted to a stop. Hemi lit the lighter again. Shakes was staring at him with a puzzled look on his face. Hemi looked at the depth gauge: rising.

"What the..." said Shakes.

"...The _Prospect_. They must have gotten under us."

"And now they're raising us to the surface? Like some newborn whale?"

"I certainly find myself overcome with awe."

Shakes stood up and took the lighter back from Hemi. He lit it and with a renewed hope for life, he crawled forward. He pushed Herschel's empty and guano-covered roost aside and pulled open a fuse box panel that lay behind it. He rummaged through a pile of old and corroded fuses that lay at the bottom of the fuse box to find one that looked like it was still at least partially conductive. He ran his finger down the rows of blown fuses till he found the one he wanted and yanked it out. The hopefully-working replacement went into the fuse box in its place.

He knew immediately that it did work because the radio panel lit up and the rapidly dwindling space of air in the sub was filled with the sound of radio static. "Try ship-to-ship!" he called back to Hemi.

Hemi picked up the mic from the front of the glowing box and squeezed the transmitter. The transmit power needle snapped to the right, just as it should. "_Prospect_, this is Hemi Howell, aboard the _Gnat_, do you copy?"

*"I sure do Hemi!"* Percy's voice came back through the box. *"We were worried that you were already flattened, and we'd just be bringing up your corpses in a squashed metal coffin! It's good to hear from you. Shakes there?"*

"Captain Shakes is here, though wet. How did you find us?"

*"Cassandra of course! She managed to pick Shakes's little sinking craft out from all the noise of the _Grackle_ going down, and then she navigated us down with dead-on precision until we were under you. Just in the nick, too! Our batteries flatlined just after we picked you up. We're rising on a gentle ballast blow right now."*

"And the _Grackle_?"

*"They are on their way down the hole, Hemi, dragged by their ram first, I hope. Cassandra said she heard the boat split, and the bulkheads failing, and then the two biggest pieces went down."*

There was now light coming through the viewport around the streams of water coming from the cracks. Shakes stuck his head between the lines of water and could just see the shadow of the _Prospect_'s sail out in the gloom.


## Epilogue


[//]: # (### Fishing and grilling)

The next morning they managed to motor out of the garbage gyre to find a patch of clear sea stretching around them in an enormous circle all the way to the horizon. By the time the sun achieved a mid-morning altitude that sent the shadow of the _Prospect_'s sail charging out over the water at an angle from the boat, the sea had turned a bright shade of slate blue. A long slow deep-ocean swell rose and fell all around, giving the impression of passing through a landscape of low hills --- though in a queasy way where the traveler feels they might be standing still and the landscape instead moves around her.

Even though it was bright daylight, they could not submerge, for the _Gnat_ lay on the deck of the _Prospect_, angled to one side by the rounded bottom and the weight of the water still in the bilge. Gregory and Bastian had secured it to the deck with heavy rusted chains and thick grimy straps of webbed cotton, winched tight as piano wires. And indeed, when the wind blew through the straps and chains, they hummed with droning tones cut up by the quick staccato of the twisting straps. On top of the drone from the straps came a number of high whistles as the wind found its way through the numerous holes in the split hull of the _Gnat_.

All those whistling splits in the _Gnat_'s hull were the reason they could not submerge. The _Gnat_ was far too damaged from its brief dip below its crush depth for them to repair it at sea. And so it rode on top of the _Prospect_ until they could put in somewhere where repairs could be attempted.

Shakes spent quite a while on the _Prospect_'s deck that morning, cataloging the damage to his boat. It was beginning to look like the _Gnat_ might end up being more weld than plate --- if it could be repaired at all. Even now, as the _Prospect_ rolled on a larger swell, water from the bilge came streaming out of the _Gnat_ in long greasy lines where the hull was split. It was enough to bring tears to Shakes's eyes.

Hemi was far less upset about the damage to the _Gnat_, and instead found himself unusually jubilant. He had been through close calls before, but never had he given up and been ready to die. He was glad to be out of the _Gnat_. And he was glad to be outside on the deck of the _Prospect_. 

Since they could not submerge without doing further damage to the _Gnat_, and since they were going to be running on the surface through all the lovely warm daylight hours, Hemi decided some grilling was in order. He opened up the hatch to the cargo hold and winched up the soot-covered black grill that had been made by welding legs onto a steel barrel, cutting it in half, and installing hinges to make the top a lid.

From the cargo hold he also hauled up a rusting platform made of welded deck grating and cut tubes. Gregory bolted this platform to the deck next to the sail. It allowed the crew to get out past the curve of the _Prospect_'s hull and stand over the water. From it hung a swim ladder that dipped down into the water below.

Hemi lashed the grill to the deck of the _Prospect_ and spent the first hours of the morning burning down some old and damp wood he found stashed in a crate in the cargo hold. Fortunately the breeze kept the fire hot enough that the moisture was quickly driven from the wood, and in a not-unreasonable amount of time Hemi had the grill bottom glowing with coals.

Below deck, Percy stopped the _Prospect_'s motors and let the boat drift. Gregory, Cassandra, and Bastian stood on the platform and ran out some long poles to drop lines into the sea. They baited the lines with sardines from a can they split open. It was not long before they had a violent mahi-mahi tearing at one of the lines, which Gregory and Cassandra together managed to haul in close enough for Hemi to heft the huge fish onto the deck from below and club it senseless with a wrench borrowed from Shakes.

Hemi cleaned the fish, leaving a sparkling trail of sticky scales across the deck of the _Prospect_, and threw the spine, tail, and various viscera back over the side. Big steaks of the meat went onto the grill and Hemi spread a rub of salt, lime juice, and red pepper flakes across it. The flesh browned and burned a little at the edges. Hemi took the smoking steaks off and dropped them into bowls of rice that Gregory brought up from the galley.

The crew sat on the deck or with legs dangling from the platform, poking at their late breakfast with old bent forks and watching the rising and falling landscape of water surrounding them. Herschel waddled among the feet of those on the deck, pecking dropped bits of rice from the steel grating. 

When Percy finished her food, she climbed the side of the sail. On the bridge, she lit a cheroot and watched the horizon as she instinctively adjusted her weight to balance against the roll of her boat. Hemi soon joined her and they both looked out over the sunlit water. 

Hemi broke the silence. "So it was Owen all along?"

"Who filled you in?"

"Cassandra."

"The little shit." Percy spat a fleck of tobacco that had caught at her lip. "Yeah. Fucking Owen. Not all along, of course, only after...you know, I left him for fucking dead."

"Do you feel that was a mistake?"

"Fuck no, Hemi. I mean, that's not what I told  Owen when I had him on the ship-to-ship and he was falling down the hole. Let the man believe whatever he wants with the literal fucking abyss approaching. But, really, fuck him. I made the rational decision, Hemi. I would make the same choice again. And even if I hadn't --- he swears himself to wreak vengeance on me? Repeatedly tries to kill me? And all of you in my crew along with me? No, Hemi. I have no regrets. I'll say it again: fuck Owen. And fuck his ghost."

"I do not believe it possible for souls to wander uneasily, except in the minds of the living. I simply wanted to be sure the events with Owen will not keep you awake nights."

"Trust me, Hemi, Owen is not fucking haunting me. The only thing haunting me is the same thing as always: where is our next job coming from?" 

The swell was coming up and the boat was rolling over further. "We need to power up the motors again, Hemi, before we get swamped."

He nodded and slipped down the hatch to the control room.

Percy tracked the incoming waves, trying to get a feel for the pattern. She closed one eye and aimed for a particular crest before throwing the remainder of her cheroot at it. The smoking butt gave off a small hiss on impact and then disappeared silently below the surface.
