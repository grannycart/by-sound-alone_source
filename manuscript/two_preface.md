## Preface 

You can skip this preface. Go ahead, I don't mind at all. Actually, I encourage you to. I'd much prefer you dove directly into the story than have you slog through these first thousand words or so for no other reason than a sense of duty or a need to complete things. "Entertainment first" is the rule here!

But if you are among those inclined to wring the most you possibly can from a book --- or if you've already _read_ this book and are back for a second pass to try to wring a bit more out of it --- well, then, for you I've got this preface to maybe shed some light on a few of the more obscure themes of the book. If you do finish the preface, you may stand to gain an ever-so-slightly fuller experience when you hit the book itself. And hey, that's a kind of entertainment too.

The core of the book (and, OK, it's not actually obscure in any way) is an exploration of how humans live with their machines. Today we have more machines doing more things for us than ever before, but the premise of this book is that there is something special about the human relationship to _mechanical_ machines. This book is about a particular type of human interaction with machines  --- the type that makes a person a "mechanic."

In the latter part of the nineteenth century and through most of the twentieth century, technology changed the world. But the technology of that time was different from ours. It was rooted in mechanical and electrical things. Back then, anyone who wanted to understand how a piece of amazing new technology worked could simply take it apart. Most things had an intuitive structure --- mechanical solutions based on logical processes. This is not the same as being _simple_. Many things from that era were in fact far more complex than today's equivalent devices. But learning how machines worked --- and how to repair them --- only required a willingness to disassemble (and then, gaining a bunch of experience putting things back together). Most parts also had a macroscopic quality. They worked on a human scale. You could see the parts without magnification, you could place a part where it belonged with your fingers rather than any kind of special tool. Today, technology is changing the world again. But if you take apart a contemporary technical object, all you will find are vanishingly small components that cannot be repaired, only replaced. And sometimes even the creators do not understand how they work.

Because of its mechanical underpinnings, that old technology also just _behaved_ more rationally. Even people without the faintest grasp of mechanical fundamentals, could learn how their machine would behave just through gaining more experience using it. And a good mechanic could tell by _feel_ that something was going wrong. Often they could guess which specific part was failing. People could depend on their technology to behave intuitively when they used it, unlike today, when even experts can be shocked by the random behavior of digital-based technology and find themselves at a loss to explain it.

This old technology also came with an aesthetic. Its mechanical nature made it dirty, greasy, and grimy. It was powered by the burning of air-fouling fuels, kept lubricated by chemical greases, and cleaned with penetrating toxic solvents. This aesthetic permeated our culture. The rich found ways to constantly clean it. The poor and the technology maintainers simply lived in and among the grime.

Stories from that mechanical age are often gripping because they tell of average people achieving amazing things with the exciting new tools available to them. Often those average people made their extraordinary tools and technologies perform far beyond their originally intended uses. To this day, people still delight in stories of electro-mechanical machines. Indeed, we may yet still be more engaged with electro-mechanical stories than with stories derived from our modern technology: nearly everyone would rather watch the building of a custom motorcycle than admire the latest achievements from a microchip clean-room. It is even possible that the pleasures offered by  mechanical things goes much deeper in the mammalian psyche than just human consciousness: it has been shown that if wild mice in a forest are given a wheel to run on, they will choose to spend their idle time spinning away.

The story told in this book is hung on technologies that anyone could understand with nothing more than a little time pondering in their armchair. The world this story lives in is confined to technology that is _non-magical_ and accessible. Mechanics become the medium for the story. More than that, I hope the reader who rides along with those who try to live among these machines can also _feel_ how the machines behave, what they can and cannot do. When this works, it becomes possible to leverage the reader's sense of how machines behave to a point where high drama can be derived from nothing more than the movements of a needle on a dial. 

Today's technology has crossed a line into the magical, and there is no way to put that technology back in the bottle even if we wanted to. But in the context of fiction, we may imagine a world where the electro-mechanical remained the dominant root of our everyday technology for far longer than it did. It is possible to imagine that, had the geopolitical and economic winds blown in a slightly different direction, commerce and industry could still be carried out by independent operators driving grease-coated machines steered by mechanical linkages. Such is the world of this book.
