description: A cross between a 1960s submarine movie and a 1970s trucker movie. It’s kind of a slurry of Das Boot, Road Warrior, Deadliest Catch, and Smokey and the Bandit. It’s about submarines. Not nuclear submarines, or modern submarines, or any kind of submarine that actually existed. It is about cargo submarines. In a mid-century Earth where, due to the economic circumstances of the world having skewed off slightly from the path followed in real life, submarines ended up being recruited to do the trucking of cargo.
