# By Sound Alone --- Notes for potential audio book

## General notes
* **Aesthetics:** When I first thought about writing this book, I was asking myself: "What would a novel be like if it resembled the aesthetics of Motörhead?" I wanted to write a book that was loud, fast, gritty, and smelled bad. I don't think I achieved that, but, you know High on Fire also set out to make Motörhead, and I don't think they got there either. But the stuff is still good. Something to consider is that an audiobook version might be an opportunity to put a bit more of the Motörhead aesthetic back in. So, say you have a bad cold and you get a serious gravelly frog in your throat. Record it! But assuming you aren't going to get sick any time soon, the Motörhead aesthetic is just something to keep in mind. The book is about people who live inside great greasy machines. There's no reason the audio should be perfect. Ideally both the it and the book itself would be full of grit and life.
* sections you can skip: diagrams, preface, License
* add: this book is released for free under a Creative Commons blah blah. For more information visit bysoundalone.net.
    * Read by Jack Hope (for more information, visit...?)
* can I get flac or other non-lossy format?


## Character notes
* **Accents and backgrounds:** Every character in the book grew up and lives in that international-shipping space where all sorts of backgrounds and cultures blend together. Conveniently, for me, that means that there's no particular rule about any character having a specific background or accent. Anyone could be anyone from anywhere, and could know about or be influenced by cultures from anywhere. (Convenient huh?) So feel free to riff on that if you like. If you think a character should have an accent that you enjoy doing or something, go for it. If they all have Amercian accents, that's fine too (except for Sir Piero --- that character needs a little zing).
* **ship-to-ship radio:** There's a bunch of interaction over "ship-to-ship" radio. This is real technology, and in real life I think it has a wobbly, frequency bending quality. But since the ship-to-ship in the book is essentially supposed to be CB radio, I think it's fine if you do your best 1970s trucker impression for those bits. 

### Captain Sylvia Percy
* Short, tough, married to her boat. 
* Super smart in a street-smart kind of way (if you can be "street" smart about ships).
* Has been working on submarines since she was a kid. Thoroughly educated by the experience. It's all she knows.
* Kind of a hard-ass. Almost always assumes she's right.
* Usually, but not always, she _is_ right. But she never learns from her mistakes. Does not really grow over the course of the novel. 
* She'll defer to Hemi on some things, but nobody else.

### Deck Boss Hemi Howell
* Huge, gentle, quiet, erudite, super-strong. 
* He knows how absolutely everything works.
* Hemi is _always_ correct --- both about mechanical issues and people management --- but defers to Sylvia for command decisions.
* Never uses contractions (part of his formal education)
* Unlike Percy, he is circumspect and reflective.
* In my head, he is from some pacific island somewhere (the name is Maori), but he got most of a formal education in some world capital, so his accent could be anything.

### Chips
* Pissed-off solid little woman mechanic
* She's angry, but she's also always right, and does _not_ defer to Percy. 

### Shakes
* Punk rock all the way: skinny, smelly, unwashed.
* Kinda insane from spending way too much time alone in his mini-sub. Or possibly from chewing too much coca leaves.
* Also kinda dumb. At least in the conventional sense. But he has a dumb-luck and sub-lingual natural ability that keeps him from dying on his sub.
* Does everything you aren't supposed to as a professional, and still succeeds (what's more punk-rock than that?)

### Cassandra
* Small, shy, scared (at least at first)
* She steadily gains confidence through the course of the book.
* Grateful to Percy for giving her a chance.
* But learns to trust Hemi to the ends of the Earth. (Many initial readers' favorite part of the book is when Hemi trains her on sonar.)

### Owen
* Young, skilled, and ambitious. Wants to help out, wants to learn the submarine trade. Willing to volunteer. Willing to work hard.
* Shows a lot of promise and potential, but still doesn't know much.
* It may be beneficial to make sure Owen's voice is distinctive because he plays a major role later in the book.

### Bastian
* Bastian and Gregory are secondary characters (as was Owen, until he turned out to play a huge part in the story).
* Honestly, I just needed them to turn the wheels that drive the sub. I think they lack distinction in some parts of the book.
* But Bastian is a tall skinny smart-ass, who doesn't show any fear in being a submariner.

### Gregory
* Gregory, on the other hand, is a stocky little dude, who doesn't want to be scared of being on a submarine because he comes from a family of submariners, but sometimes he can't help it, and he let's slip that he's terrified of this work.
* "Handsome" Gregory... because he's ugly as fuck.

### Miss Mai 
* Remember Aughra from The Dark Crystal? That's Miss Mai.
* She's a tiny old crone who knows things about the wider world far beyond her station.
* Though she's also running a semi-legal logistic business, so she's got a toughness and canniness to her.
* She pulls strings that brought Percy to her, and gives Percy the job that takes her deeper into the story.

### Sir Piero
* Sir Piero is a small dude with a lot of hustle.
* Uniquely among the characters, he is from a specific place and culture: "Stilt City". Though I did not specify where that actually is. Somewhere in Southeast Asia probably, though maybe also a coastal part of South America. Somewhere with a colonial history (hence the "Sir" and the vaguely European surname). Though also a major international city with many cultures influencing it, in addition to the strong influence of the local indigenous culture. 
* Sir Piero is (I think) the only character who definitely has SOME kind of accent --- it's in the dialog. But there's no rule about what exactly it is.
